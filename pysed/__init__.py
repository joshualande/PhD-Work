""" pysed

    An object oriented package for computing spectral energy
    distributions of astrophysical sources in python. 

    This code differs from other SED packages in valuing human readability
    and conceptual clarity over computational efficiency.

    Consequently, this code may not be fast enough for professional work
    and is designed primarily as a teaching aid.

    Notes: 
        * R&L is Rybicki and Lightman "Radiative Processes in Astrophysics

    Dependencies:
        * numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sympy

    General implementation notes:
        * Keep everything object oriented so that it is flexible.
        * As much as possible, vectorize the calculations using numpy and scipy
        * Try to perform most integrals using the simpson method so
          that the integrand evaluation can be vectorized.
        * When integrating over energy, sample points uniformly in
          log space (see sed_integrate.logsimps).
