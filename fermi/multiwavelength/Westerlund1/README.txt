files Wd1_HESS_Fermi_template.fits and Westerlund1_spectrum.txt came from private email with Stefan Ohm:

        Hi Joshua,

        sure - I've attached Figure 1 and the contours as one fits file. I've
        cropped the images to only include information that might be of relevance
        for you. The spectral points in numerical form are attached as well.

        All the best, Stefan

The file Westerlund1_spectrum.yaml was created from Westerlund1_spectrum.txt for the 1.1 degree region.
