The file hessj1356_VHE-SNcontours_5-7-9sigma.con came from a private email with Matthieu Renaud
and refer to H.E.S.S. analysis of the HESS J1356-645 region presented in arXiv:1108.2855v1.

    Indeed, we haven't uploaded yet the HESS J1356-645 image and spectral data points on the HESS website. So please find in attachment the 5-7-9 sigma HESS significance contours, as in Fig. 1 of the article (in case you load them in ds9, you'll have to set the coordinate system to "galactic"). Below are the spectral data points, with:
    Energy (TeV) | dN/dE (cm-2.s-1.TeV-1) | 68 % error on dN/dE (cm-2.s-1.TeV-1) |

    1.50 1.30e-12 4.23e-13
    2.41 2.51e-13 1.36e-13
    3.86 1.66e-13 5.10e-14
    6.22 5.49e-14 1.90e-14
    10.0 1.81e-14 7.33e-15
    16.1 4.57e-15 3.66e-15

    Let me know in case I can be of any further help!
    Cheers,

    Matthieu
