Suggested Title:
    Large Area Telescope Search for Pulsar Wind Nebulae for high
    \dot E Pulsars with no $\gamma$-ray Pulsations

Benefits:
    Improved time range (XXX months vs XXX months in 2PC)
    Improved uppper limit from likelihood test.

    Better analysis method (search for extended sources, could be more sensitive?)
    Look for hard-index sources (unlike 2PC).

    For example, Lande et al 2012 discovered Gamma-ray emission
    from HESS J1616-508 which is associated with PSR J1617-5055.
    

Note: Table 3 & 4 get upper limits assuming cutoff spectrum, not suitable
for PWNe searches. For describing of 2PC flux upper limits, see
