\begin{abstract}
We present a new method for analyzing 
the spatial extension of sources with
the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the
{\em Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. 
The source extension is an important input to correctly 
associate LAT sources with their counterparts at other
wavelengths. We provide
a series of Monte Carlo studies to validate this tool and calculate
the LAT's detection threshold to spatially extended sources.  We then
apply this tool to test all sources in the two year source catalog for
extension. We present on the detection of nine spatially extended sources
in addition to the twelve spatially extended sources reported in the
second Fermi-LAT Catalog (2FGL).

\section{Introduction}

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair conversion telescope on the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (FGST). It has been surveying the $\gamma$-ray
sky since June 2008.  Fermi has a broad energy coverage (20 \mev to $>300$
\gev), wide field of view ($\approx 2.4 \sr$), and large effective area
($\approx 8000 \cm^2$ at $>1 \gev$).

Using two years of all sky surveying data, the LAT Collaboration published
a catalog of 1873 \gev sources\cite{second_cat}. Many of these can be
positionally associated with a variety of source classes including Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN), pulsars, galaxies, and supernova remnants (SNRs).
While many of the LAT sources can be spatially resolved when observed
at other frequencies, detection of an extension at \gev energies by
the LAT is complicated by the rather large point-spread function (PSF)
of the instrument. The angular resolution for events converting in the
front part of the detector, defined as the 68\% containment radius for
a point source, is approximately $3.5^{\circ}$ at 100 \mev, improving
to about 0.1$^{\circ}$ at 10 \gev.

However, a number of sources positionally coincident with LAT sources
exhibit extension at other wavelengths which are larger or comparable to
the LAT PSF.  In particular certain SNRs, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe),
molecular clouds, normal galaxies, galaxy clusters or dark matter
satellites can therefore be expected to be observed as spatially extended
sources in the LAT.  The LAT collaboration has previously reported on the
discovered of five spatially extended supernova remnants, IC443, W28, W44,
W51C, and RX J1713.7-3946 (\cite{ic443,w28,w44,w51c,rx_j1713_lat}). In
addition, three extended PWNe were detected: MSH 15-52, Vela~X,
and HESS\,J1825-137 (\cite{msh1552,velax,fermi_hess_j1825}), as well
as two close-by galaxies, the Large Magellanic and Small Magalenic
Cloud (\cite{lmc,smc}), and finally the radio galaxy Centarus A
(\cite{cen_a_lat}) .

For each of these sources, the extension was determined based on
dedicated analysis of the particular source or region of interest
instead of being the outcome of a systematic search of the LAT catalog.
For the systematic scan of all LAT catalog sources presented here, we
therefore expect to find additional spatially extended LAT sources, in
particular since many extended sources in the Galactic plane have been
detected at \tev energies using Air Cherenkov detectors and \tev and
\gev emission often originates from the same population of high-energy
particles.  A variety of spatially extended sources have been detected
in the Galactic plane at \tev energies. Most prominent was a survey of
the Galactic plane using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S)
which presented 14 spatially extended sources
 with extensions varying from
$~0.1\deg$ to $~0.25\deg$ (\cite{hess_plane_survey}). In fact, within
our Galaxy only very few sources (most notably the $\gamma$-ray binaries
LS\,5039 (\cite{HESSLS5039}), LS I+61-303 (\cite{MAGICLSI, VERITASLSI})
and HESS\,J0632+057 (\cite{HESS0632}) are amongst the few Galactic sources
for which no significant extension was detected at \tev energies. Given
these findings, it can be expected that if the source population at \gev
energies has similar properties, that at least some of the Fermi-LAT
sources in our Galaxy should be spatially resolvable at \gev energies.

Being able to spatially resolve the \gev emission from a source is
important for several reasons. Because of the large PSF and the large
candidate source density in our Galaxy, source confusion is a severe
problem for the identification of LAT sources.  Finding a coherent
source extension across different energy bands allows a firm association
of a LAT source to an otherwise confused counterpart.  Because of the
strongly varying PSF of the LAT, the spatial and spectral information
about a source do not simply decouple. A biased spatial model will bias
the spectral model of the source. In particular, performing a spectral
analysis on a spatially extended source modeled as point-like will
systematically shift the spectral index to be softer.  Furthermore,
correctly modeling a source's extension is important for improving
the model of the sky and removing excess residuals, for example in the
region around surrounding the Large Magellanic Cloud (\cite{first_cat}).
Additionally, such excess residuals potentially bias the significance
and measured spectrum of neighboring sources in the densely populated
Galactic plane.

\section{Analysis Methods}

Morphological studies of sources in the \gev energy range using the
LAT are challenging because of the significantly energy-dependent PSF.
Additional complications arise close to the Galactic plane due to
systematic uncertainties in the Galactic diffuse emission.  The LAT's
PSF is limited at lower energies by multiple scattering in the tracker
and the 68\% containment radius of the PSF is approximately 5.1\deg
at 100 \mev  when averaged over instrument acceptance and including
photons which convert in either the thick or thin layers of the
tracker. The PSF improves with energy and approaches a limit given
by the granularity of the silicon strips and is 0.14\deg at 10 \gev
(\cite{on_orbit_calibration}).  The high resolution of the higher
energy photons in the LAT energy range however is offset by their low
statistics. Therefore a detailed investigation has been performed in this
work to determine the optimal energy range to measure source extension
(see below).

\subsection{The \pointlike Package}

A new analysis tool has been developed to address the unique requirements
for studying spatially extended sources with the LAT. The tool
provides a maximum likelihood analysis where the Poisson likelihood
for observing the measured counts is maximized,
given a parametrized spatial and spectral model of 
the source and its surrounding region.
The extension of a source can be modeled by a
geometric shape (e.g. a disk or Gaussian) and the source's position,
extension, and spectrum can be simultaneously fit.

This analysis is not feasible using the standard LAT likelihood
analysis tool \gtlike\footnote{\gtlike is distributed publicly by the
Fermi Science Support Center (\cite{fssc})} because \gtlike can only 
fit the spectral parameters of the model. 

We note that \gtlike has been used in the past in several studies of
source extension in the LAT collaboration (\cite{lmc,smc,w28,w51c}).
Based upon a set of \gtlike maximum likelihood fits at fixed extensions,
a profile of the likelihood as a function of the extension was calculated.
This approach is not optimal because the position, extension, and
spectrum of the source must be simultaneously fit to find the best fit
parameters and to correctly compute the statistical significance of the
detection.  Furthermore since the \gtlike likelihood profile approach
is computationally intensive, no large-scale Monte Carlo effort can be
run to validate it.

The approach presented here is based on a second maximum likelihood
fitting package developed in the LAT collaboration and called \pointlike
(\cite{first_cat,matthew_kerr_thesis}).  We extended the code to allow
a simultaneous fit of the source extension together with the position
and the spectral parameters.

The choice to base the spatial extension fitting on \pointlike
rather than \gtlike was made on considerations of computing time.
The \pointlike algorithm was optimized for speed to handle
larger numbers of sources efficiently which is important for
our catalog scan as well as the Monte Carlo validation of our method.
Details on the \pointlike package can be found in (\cite{matthew_kerr_thesis}).

\subsection{Extension Fitting}
\label{extension_fitting}

In \pointlike, it is assumed that the spatial and spectral
model of an extended source are separable, i.e. that the source
model $M(l,b,E)=S(l,b)\times X(E)$.  To fit an extended source,
\pointlike convolves the extended source shape with the PSF (as a
function of energy) and uses the \minuit library to maximize the
likelihood by simultaneously varying the position and extension of
the source (\cite{minuit_documentation}).  As will be described in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}, simultaneously fitting the position
and extension is necessary to correctly calculate the statistical
significance of the detection of extension.  For each position and
extension, the spectral parameters of the sky model are refit.  To avoid
projection effects, the fitted source position parameters are not the
source's longitude and latitude but instead the source's displacement
in a rotated reference frame.

The significance of the extension of a source can be calculated
from \tsext, which 
is the test statistic of the likelihood ratio test of
a model with a spatially extended source and a model
with a point-like source and defined as
\begin{equation}
  \tsext=2\log(\loglikelihood_\text{ext}/\loglikelihood_\text{ps}).
\end{equation}
where \loglikelihood is the log of the Poisson likelihood.
\pointlike calculates \tsext by fitting a source first with a spatially
extended model and then as a point source.  The interpretation
of \tsext in terms of a statistical significance is discussed in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}.

For extended sources with an assumed radially symmetric shape,
we use a semi-analytic calculation to speed up the calculation of
the expected photon distribution. The expected photon 
distribution can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(\vec r) = \int  \text{PSF}(|\vec r - \vec r'|)I_\text{src}(\vec r') d A'.
\end{equation}
For the LAT, the PSF can be parameterized by a {\em King function}
\begin{equation}
  \text{PSF}(\vec r) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}
  \left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left(1+\frac{u}{\gamma}\right)^{-\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ are free parameters
(\cite{matthew_kerr_thesis}).  For radially symmetric extended sources,
the angular part of the integral can be done analytically
\begin{align}
  \text{PDF}(u) & = \int_0^\infty \sigma^2 dv 
  I_\text{src}(v) 
  \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi' 
  \text{PSF}(\sqrt{2\sigma^2(u+v-2\sqrt{uv}\cos(\phi-\phi'))})
  \\
  & = \int_0^\infty dv
  I_\text{src}(v) 
  \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma + u + v}\right)^\gamma 
  \times {}_2F_1 \left(\gamma/2,\frac{1+\gamma}{2},1,\frac{4uv}{(\gamma+u+v)^2}\right).
\end{align}
where $u=(r/\sigma)^2/2$, $v=(r'/\sigma)^2/2$, and ${}_2F_1$ is the
Gaussian hypergeometric function.  This convolution formula is used by
\pointlike, reducing the calculation of the expected photon distribution
to a single numerical integral.

There will always be a small numerical discrepancy between the expected
photon distribution derived from a true point source and a very small
extended source due to numerical error in the convolution.  In most
situations, this error would be insignificant.  But in particular for
very bright sources, this numerical error has the potential to bias the
test statistic for the extension test.  the source with an extended shape
to the likelihood fitting it with its extension fixed to ${10^{-10}}\deg$.

We estimate the errors on the extension
by recalculating the likelihood for a set of extension values
while keeping the position fixed.

We estimate the error on the extension of a source by fixing the position
of the source and varying the extension until the likelihood has fallen
by $\tfrac{1}{2}$, corresponding to a $1\sigma$ error.  This method is
shown schematically in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(a) which shows the
change in \loglikelihood when varying the extension of the SNR IC443.
The localization error is calculated by fixing the extension and spectrum
of the source and fitting a Gaussian to the likelihood as a function
of position.

\subsection{\gtlike Analysis Validation}
\label{gtlike_crosscheck}

\pointlike is important for LAT analysis that require many iterations
such as source localization and extension fitting.  On the other hand,
because of the fewer approximations used in calculating the likelihood
we expect the spectral parameters found with \gtlike to be slightly
more precise.  Furthermore, because \gtlike is the standard likelihood
analysis package, it has been more extensively validated for spectral
analysis.  For that reason, in the following analysis  we use \pointlike
to determinate the position and extension of a source and then determine
the spectrum using \gtlike. Both \gtlike and \pointlike can be 
used to estimate
the statistical significance of the extension of a source and we require
that both methods agree to claim a detection.

We found good agreement between the two methods. For the new extended
source candidates, table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} will shows a
comparison of the test statistic \ts and \tsext computed using \pointlike
and \gtlike.  Unless explicitly mentioned, all \ts, \tsext, and spectral
parameters were calculated using \gtlike using \pointlike's positions
and extensions.

\subsection{Dual Localization}
\label{dual_localization_method}

There is a degeneracy between a spatially extended source and multiple
point sources that are separated by angular distances comparable or
smaller than the size of the LAT PSF.  To assess the possibility of source
confusion, we developed a function in \pointlike to simultaneously fit
the position of two point sources.

We define \tsinc as twice the increase in \loglikelihood fitting the
region as two point sources compared to fitting the region as one point
source: 
\begin{equation}
  \tsinc=2\times(\loglikelihood_\text{2pts}-\loglikelihood_\text{ps}).
\end{equation} 
\tsinc can not be directly compared to \tsext to see which
model is more significant because the models are not nested
(\cite{statistics_with_care}). Even though the comparison of \tsext with
\tsinc is not a calibrated test, we find the cases $\tsinc \ll \tsext$
or $\tsinc\gg\tsext$ suggestive and we only consider a source to be
extended if $\tsext>\tsinc$.

Like extended sources described in section~\ref{gtlike_crosscheck},
the spectrum of the two point sources can be refit using \gtlike.
We quote the spectral values obtained from \gtlike using the best fit
positions found using \pointlike.  For the extended candidates found
by our search, we computed both \tsext and \tsinc.  The results will be
presented in table~\ref{dual_localization_results}.

\subsection{Comparing Source Sizes}

\label{compare_source_size}

We tested two different models for the
spatial shape, either a two dimensional Gaussian
\begin{equation}\label{gauss_pdf}
  I(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}\exp\left(-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma^2\right)
\end{equation}
or a uniform disk
\begin{equation}\label{disk_pdf}
  I(x,y)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\pi\sigma^2} & x^2+y^2\le\sigma^2 \\
    0                      & x^2+y^2>\sigma^2
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Although these shapes are significantly different, the convolution
of them with the PSF look similar.  Figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss}
demonstrates this by showing $I_\text{src}$, the PSF, and the PDF for
a uniform disk and Gaussian spatial model of size 0.5\deg.\footnote{To
allow a valid comparison between Gaussian and disk shaped morphologies,
we define the source size for this test as the radius containing
68\% of the intensity ($\rsixeight$).  $\rsixeight_\text{,Gaussian}=1.51\sigma$
and $\rsixeight_\text{,disk}=0.82\sigma$ where $\sigma$
is defined in equation~\ref{gauss_pdf} and
equation~\ref{disk_pdf} respectively.} This plot shows that we are
not very sensitive to probing the exact structure of an extended source.
In the search for extended sources, we therefore use only a uniform
disk as our spatial extension shape. We then quote the radius of the
disk edge as the size of the source.

\section{Validation of Analysis Method}

\subsection{Significance of Extension}
\label{monte_carlo_validation}

Mattox et al. discuss that the test statistic distribution
for a likelihood ratio test on the existence of a source at
a given position is \cite{mattox_egret}
\begin{equation}\label{ts_ext_distribution}
  P(\ts)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\chi^2_1(\ts)+\delta(\ts)).
\end{equation}
The particular form of equation \ref{ts_ext_distribution} is
due to the null hypothesis (source flux $\Phi=0$) residing
on the edge of parameter space and the model hypothesis
adding a single degree of freedom. It is plausible to
expect a similar distribution of the test statistic
in the test for source extension as the same conditions
apply (with source flux $\Phi$ replaced by source radius $r$).
To validate this claim, we performed a Monte Carlo
study to calculate empirical distributions for $\tsext$ and
compared them to equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution}.

We simulated point sources of varying spectral models using
\gtobssim\footnote{\gtobssim is distributed
by the Fermi Science Support Center (\cite{fssc}).}
and fit them
them using \pointlike as both point and extended sources. 
The point sources were simulated with a power-law spectral model 
with integrated fluxes above 100 \mev ranging from
$3\times 10^{-9}$ to $10^{-6} \ph/\cm^2/\sec$ in
six discrete steps and spectral
indices ranging from 1.5 to 3 in four discrete steps.
These values were picked to
to represent typical source parameters in LAT-detected sources. The point
sources were simulated on top of an isotropic 
background with an integrated flux above 100 \mev of $1.5\times10^{-5}$
(\cite{sreekumar_isotropic}).  The Monte Carlo simulation was
performed over a one year observation period
using a default rocking profile
and a representative livetime fraction of 0.8.  The reconstruction was
performed using 1-100 \gev photons 
and the 
Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6) Source Instrument
Response Function (IRFs).  For each point source, we used \pointlike
to fit it as both a point and extended source and calculate \tsext and
we only kept the sources which had a significant point source detection
($\ts>25$).


For most of the spectral models, ~30,000 statistically independent
simulations were performed. For the dimmer spectral models, many of the
simulations left the source undetected ($\ts<25$)
and were discarded.  Table~\ref{ts_ext_num_sims}
shows the different spectral models used in our study as well as the
number of simulations.  The cumulative density of \tsext is plotted in
figure~\ref{ts_ext_mc}. The $\chi^2_1/2$ distribution of
equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution} is overlaid for comparison.

Our Monte Carlo study shows broad agreement between simulations and
equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution}. Nevertheless, the agreement is not
perfect.  It should be noted that the discrepancy seems to be worst for
bright sources, a likely cause being numerical errors in the convolution
becoming more apparent for sufficiently bright sources.  Other possible
reasons for departure from equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution} could
be that \pointlike ignores energy dispersion which would change the
PSF's shape as a function of energy. We emphasize that most of the
time, our empirical curve lies to the left of the theoretical curve so
using the theoretical distribution would lead to an underestimate of the
statistical significance of a detection. Therefore, we are confident that
$\sqrt{\tsext}$ can be used as a conservative measure of the statistical
significance of a source's extension and use it in the following analysis.

\section{Extended Source Detection Threshold}\label{extension_sensitivity}

We calculated the LAT's detection threshold to spatially extended
sources. We define the detection threshold as the flux at which the value
of $\tsext$ averaged over many statistical representations of a source
is $\langle\tsext\rangle=16$ corresponding to a $4\sigma$ detection
(see section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}).

We used the simulation setup described in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}, but instead simulated extended
sources with a uniform radially symmetric disk spatial model and
instead over the actual two year time interval.  For each extension and
spectral index, we picked a flux range which bracketed $\tsext=16$. We
then picked ten flux points in this range and repeatedly simulated
and then performed extension tests of the simulated extended source.
We calculated $\langle\tsext\rangle=16$ by fitting a line to the flux
and $\tsext$ values.

Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows the threshold for sources of four
spectral indices from 1.5 to 3 and extension varying from $\sigma=0.1\deg$
to $2.0\deg$.  The LAT's threshold to extension is better for harder
sources with more high energy photons and the threshold is best for
sources with an extension $\approx0.5\deg$ and is significantly worse
for very small extended small.  Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows
the threshold using photons with energies between 100 \mev and 100 \gev
and also using only photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev.
Except for the hardest and largest sources, our detection threshold is
almost unchanged when including photons with energies between 100 \mev and
1 \gev.  This is also demonstrated in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(b)
which shows \tsext for the SNR IC443 computed independently in twelve
energy bins between 100 \mev and 100 \gev. For IC443, which has a
spectral index $\approx2.4$, almost the entire increase in \ts comes
from energies above 1 \gev.  On the other hand, other systematic errors
become increasingly important at low energy. For our extension search,
we use only only photons with energy above 1 \gev.

Figure~\ref{diff_factor_sensitivity} shows how the LAT's detection
threshold increases with increasing background. We compute the threshold
using 1, 10, and 100 times the Sreekumar-like isotropic background. The
latter factor approximately represents the intensity of the Galactic
diffuse emission near the Galactic center.  The figure shows the threshold
using only photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev and aldo
when using only photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. We
are less sensitive to extended sources with higher background. Also,
given the same flux we are more sensitive to the source if those
photons have a higher energies.

Overlaid on figure~\ref{diff_factor_sensitivity} are the LAT
detected extended sources from table~\ref{known_extended_sources} and
table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  The extended sources are color coded
based upon whether the galactic diffuse and isotropic emission model is
closer to 1, 10, or 100 times the Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum.

Finally, figure~\ref{all_sensitivity} shows the LAT's detection threshold
for all four spectral indices (1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3) against all three
background levels (1, 10, and 100 times the Sreekumar-like isotropic
background).  For a fixed 1 \gev to 100 \gev or 10 \gev to 100 \gev
flux, the LAT's detection threshold is only weakly depends upon the
spectral index.  This effect is most pronounced when using only photons
with energies above 10 \gev. The extension thresholds are tabulated in
table~\ref{all_sensitivity_table}.

\section{Extended Source Search Method}

2FGL is a list of 1873 \gev sources detected by the LAT.  2FGL included
twelve previously published spatially extended sources but did not
attempt to fit the extension of these sources. Other than these sources,
all 2FGL sources were modeled as point sources and 2FGL did not attempt to
resolve the extension of new sources.  In this paper, we tested all 2FGL
sources for extension to search for new spatially extended \gev sources.

For this search, we build a model of the
sky consistent with 2FGL.   We used the same two
years of data from August 4, 2008 to August 1, 2010 and we used the same
Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6) Source class event selections and 
Instrument Response Functions (IRFs, \cite{lat_on_orbit_psf}).  We used the same Galactic diffuse,
isotropic diffuse, and earth limb emission model. The spectrum of the
Galactic and isotropic diffuse models were refit during the analysis
while the earth limb emission was fixed to it's predicted value.

As was shown, we gain little in sensitivity using photons with energies
below 1 \gev. On the other hand, the large PSF at low energy makes us
more susceptible to systematic errors arising from source confusion due
to multiple point sources and susceptible to incorrect modeling of the
Galactic diffuse emission. In addition, the Galactic diffuse emission
is more pronounced at lower energies due to its steep energy spectrum.
For that reason, we performed our search using photons only between 1
\gev and 100 \gev.  We used 4 energy bins per each logarithmic decade
in energy.

We also performed a search for extended sources using photons only
between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. Even though we are testing the same
sources, this approach is complimentary because the Galactic diffuse
emission is even less dominant above 10 \gev. Furthermore, source
confusion becomes less of a problem since most LAT sources are not
significant at energies above 10 \gev.  Using higher energies, we might
expect to detect harder sources in more complicated regions. This is
beneficial for regions near pulsars which cutoff before 10 \gev and was
successfully used in detecting HESS\,J1825-137 and MSH 15-52 with the LAT
(\cite{msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}).

For each catalog source, we tested it for extension using \pointlike
assuming the source had a uniform radially symmetric disk spatial model.
We used a circular $10\deg$ region of interest centered on our source and
included all catalog sources within $15\deg$ of the source of interest.
We refit the spectral parameters of sources within $2\deg$ of the source.
We modeled each source with a power-law spectral model. This was reasonable because for a source to be significantly
extended, it would have to be fairly hard and fit reasonably well by
a power-law. Second, since we began the analysis at either 1 \gev or
10 \gev, we didn't expect there to be significant curvature over this
energy range.

Finally, when analyzing the region, we automatically removed other
2FGL sources which were within 0.5\deg of the source of interest. This was done because of
a concern that extended sources would end up 2FGL as
multiple point sources. These spurious sources would then
distort the extension fit.
For each extended candidate, we performed a dual localization procedure
(described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method} to test if the
source is extended. We select the sources where $\tsext>16$.

\subsection{Additional Analysis}

Since extragalactic sources are typically too far away to be resolvable,
we expect most extended sources to be inside our Galaxy and most
likely on the Galactic plane.  Unfortunately, the \gev emission
in the Galactic plane is dominated by extremely structured Galactic
diffuse emission.  Finding sources on top of this emission is difficult
(\cite{first_diffuse_paper}) as has been discussed in 1FGL and 2FGL
(\cite{first_cat,second_cat}).  Furthermore, the Galactic plane is crowded
and it is often difficult to correctly model nearby sources.  Because of this,
finding a source with $\tsext>16$ is not a sufficient
criteria for resolving a source. For each extended source,
we perform several analysis crosschecks.

As an example of why this is important, we describe the test of 
2FGL\,J1856.2+0450c for extension.  Figure~\ref{example_bad_fit} shows
a Galactic and isotropic diffuse emission subtracted
smoothed counts map of this source using photons with energy 
between 1 \gev and 100 \gev. 
In this region along the Galactic plane, there appears to be 
large-scale residual in the diffuse emission. As a result, 2FGL\,J1856.2+0450c 
fit to an extension of 1.83\deg and the result is statistically significant
with \tsext=45.4.  By looking at the residuals, it is clear that this
complicated region is not fit well even though the source's extension is
statistically significant. For this reason, we manually discard
the extension of this and similar sources.

For each extended source candidate,
we took the spatial and spectral model found using \pointlike and
performed a crosscheck by refitting the spectral parameters using
\gtlike.  We used a square ROI $14.1\deg$ in diameter with $1/32\deg$
spatial bins and the same energy binning as \pointlike. Using \gtlike,
we found a second measure of \tsext, this time not fitting the extension
but using a fixed template with the extension determined by \pointlike.
We only considered a source to be significantly extended if \pointlike
and \gtlike both agreed.  For the new extended source candidates,
table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} will show a comparison of of \tsext for
\gtlike and \pointlike.

For each candidate, we generated a map of residual \ts
by adding a new source of spectral index 2 into the region and finding
the increase in likelihood when fitting its flux. \ts maps are useful
to look for residual structure in the sky mode.  Figure~\ref{res_tsmaps}
shows a residual \ts map for the extended source IC443.

For each candidate, we generated plots of the sum of all counts
within a given distance of the source and compared it to the model
predictions of a point source.  The plots were binned uniformly
in $\Delta \theta^2$ so that an isotropic background would be flat.
An example radial integral plot is shown for the extended source IC443
in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(c).  For each source, we also made
Galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission subtracted smoothed counts
maps. Figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(d) shows an example for IC443. 

For each source, we tested to see if the region contained instead
multiple point sources by replacing the extended source with
two point sources and performed the dual localization procedure
described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method}.  We only
considered a source to be extended if $\tsext>\tsinc$.  For the new
extended sources, we will show the results of this dual localization in
table~\ref{dual_localization_results}.

Because of the high source density in the Galactic plane, for promising
candidates we often had to iteratively improve the model of our background
sources to obtain a better fit of the sources.  Often, several catalog
sources would fill in the emission of the extended source and would
have to be removed from the region.  Similarly, background sources
were often insignificant in the fit energy range and had to be removed.
The position of background sources would often have to be refit once the
extended source was fit.  When the model of the extended source coupled
strongly with nearby sources, we iteratively fit the extended source and
all nearby sources until the fit converged.  For each extended source,
we describe the modification that were required.

\subsection{Systematic Errors on Extension}
\label{systematic_errors_on_extension}

% Alternative PSF

We estimate a systematic error on the extension of a source due to
uncertainty in our knowledge of the angular resolution of the LAT.  Before
launch, the LAT PSF was determined by a detector simulation which was
verified in accelerator tests (\cite{atwood_LAT_mission}).  A discrepancy
was found in flight data above a few \gev in the PSF compared to the
shape of bright AGN.  A publication on this issue is in preparation
(\cite{lat_on_orbit_psf}).  Subsequently, the PSF was fit empirically to
bright AGN and this empirical parameterization is the default PSF used
in the P7\_V6 IRFs.  To account for this uncertainty in our knowledge of
the PSF, we refit our extended source candidates using the Monte Carlo
representation of the PSF and consider the difference in extension found
using the two PSFs as a systematic error on the extension of a source.
Because the Monte Carlo representation of the PSF is smaller, it leads
to unphysically higher \tsext values.  This same approach was used in
(\cite{ic443}).  At high energies, we believe that our parameterization
of the PSF from bright AGN is substantially better than the Monte Carlo
representation of the PSF so this systematic errors is conservative.

% Alternate Diffuse

We estimate a second systematic error on the extension of a source
due to uncertainty in the model of the Galactic diffuse emission by
using an alternative diffuse model. The alternative model was based on
the GALPROP\footnote{GALPROP is a software package for calculating the
Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission based on a model of cosmic-ray propagation
in the Galaxy. See \url{http://galprop.stanford.edu/} for details and
references} model used in the LAT analysis of the isotropic diffuse
emission (\cite{isotropic_lat}).  With this model, we independently fit
along with the point and diffuse sources in the region seven HI rings,
seven HII rings, the inverse component, the E(B-V) residual, and the
isotropic component of the background emission.  All told, we fit in
the region 18 diffuse templates.  This same crosscheck was used in the
LAT Collaboration's analysis of RX J1713.7-3946 (\cite{rx_j1713_lat}).

It is not expected that this diffuse model is more physical.
But adding degrees of freedom to the background model can remove
likely spurious sources that correlate with features in the Galactic
diffuse emission.  Therefore, this tests systematics that may be
due to incorrect modeling of the diffuse emission in the region.
The results of this fit for the new extended source candidates are shown
in table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results}. There is good agreement between
the \ts using the standard and alternative diffuse models, suggesting
that the sources are robust against features in the diffuse model.

We do not except the systematic error due to uncertainties in the PSF to
be correlated to the systematic due to uncertainty in the Galactic diffuse
emission so the total systematic error on the extension of a source so
we obtain the total systematic error by adding them in quadrature.

\section{Analysis of Extended Sources in 2FGL}
\label{validate_known}

% 6 SNRs 

We first present on our analysis of the twelve extended sources
included in 2FGL.
(\cite{second_cat}).
The six extended SNRs IC443, W28, W30, W44, W51C, and the
Cygnus Loop were included in 2FGL.  IC443, W28, W44, W51C were
first reported in (\cite{ic443,w28,w44,w51c}).  Detailed papers
by the LAT collaboration studying W30 and the Cygnus Loop are
still in preparation.  \gev emission from W30 was also studied in
(\cite{castro_and_slane_2010}).  Using photons with energies between
1 \gev and 100 \gev, our analysis significantly detected the extension
of all six SNRs. 
% 2 galaxies

Two nearby galaxies the Large Magalenic Cloud and the Small Magalenic
Cloud were included in 2FGL (\cite{lmc,smc}).  They were significantly
detected using photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev. Our
fit extension is comparable to the published result, but we note that
previous publication used a more complicated double Gaussian spatial
model when fitting the LMC.

% 3 PWN
Three pulsar wind nebula Vela X, MSH 15-52, and HESS\,J1825-137 were
included in 2FGL (\cite{velax,msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}).  Using photons
with energy above 10 \gev, we significantly detected the extension of
HESS\,J1825-137.  To improve the model of this source, we removed the
nearby catalog source 2FGL\,J1823.1-1338c which is part of the extended
source.  To avoid the nearby pulsar PSR J1509-5850, MSH 15-52 must be
analyzed at high energies.  Using photons with energies above 10 \gev,
we fit the extension of MSH 15-52 to be consistent with the published
size with an extension significance of \tsext=6.5.  

% failed to detect vela x + cen a
Our analysis was unable to resolve Vela X which would have required first
removing the pulsed photons from the Vela pulsar. This is beyond the
scope of this paper.  Our analysis also failed to detect a significant
extension for the Centaurus A Lobes (\cite{cen_a_lat}). This is because
the source's emission is significantly more complicated than a uniform
radially symmetric Disk.

Our analysis of these sources is summarized in
table~\ref{known_extended_sources}.  This table includes the best fit
position and extension of these sources when fitting them with a radially
symmetric uniform disk spatial model.  It also includes the best fit
spectral parameters for each source.  The position and extension of Vela
X and the Centaurus A Lobes are included in this list for completeness.

\section{Test of 1LAC Sources}
\label{test_1lac_sources}

To validate our method, we test associated AGN for extension.  \gev
emission from AGN is believed to comes from the core of supermassive
blackholes in small regions in the core of distant galaxies. Therefore AGN
are not expected to be spatially resolvable and provide a good calibration
source to demonstrate the efficacy of our tool. Nevertheless, it would
be interesting if AGN could be spatially resolved and there are theories
that predict this (\cite{pair_halo_paper}).

Following 1FGL, the LAT collaboration published a list of sources that
had a high probability association with AGN (\cite{first_agn_cat}).
1FGL had 709 1FGL sources associated with 671 distinct AGN at high
latitude ($|b|>10\deg$).  An upcoming publication by the LAT collaboration
using two years of data and the 2FGL catalog associates 1017 2FGL sources
with AGN.  To avoid systematic problems with AGN classification, we
selected the 815 AGN which made it into the clean AGN sample.  An AGN
association is considered clean only if it has a high probability
of association $P\ge 80\%$, if it is the only AGN associated with the
catalog source, and if there are no flags on the source in 2FGL. These
last two conditions are important for our analysis. Source
confusion may look like a spatially extended source and flagged catalog
sources may correlate with unmodeled structure in the diffuse emission.

Of the 815 clean AGN, we select 775 of these 2FGL sources which
are significant above 1 \gev and fit each of them for extension.
A histogram of the \tsext values computed for these AGN is shown in
figure~\ref{agn_ts_ext}. Overlaid on the plot is the $\chi^2/2$
distribution of equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution}.
The \tsext distribution for AGN shows good
agreement with the theoretical distribution.  Two sources had $\tsext>9$.
One was due to incorrectly pruning a nearby catalog sources and the
other was due to a failure of convergence of the point hypothesis.
This result demonstrates that we can use \tsext as a measure of the
statistical significance of the detection of the extension of a source.

We should clarify that the LAT PSF used in this study was determined
empirically by fitting the observed shape of bright AGN (see
section~\ref{systematic_errors_on_extension}). Finding that the AGN we
test are not extended is not surprising. Trying to look for the extension
of AGN would require a more specialized analysis.

Nine extended sources not include in 2FGL were found using this search.
Three were found in our search using photons with energies between
1 \gev and 100 \gev and six were found using photons with energies between
10 \gev and 100 \gev.  The fit properties of these nine sources is summarized in
table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  This table includes for each source
the best fit position, extension, spectrum, source significance, and
significance of extension. 

For the new extended sources, table~\ref{dual_localization_results}
presents a test for source confusion by fitting the region
as two point sources. The table compares \tsext to \tsinc and
summarizes the positions and spectra of the two sources. 
Table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} contains the fit extensions

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J0823.0-4246 was found 
using 1-100 \gev photons to have an 
extension of $0.37\deg\pm0.03\deg\stat\pm0.02\deg\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of $\tsext=46.3$.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(260.32\deg,-3.28\deg)$.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248} shows a
counts map of this source.  This source is coincident with the one year
catalog source 1FGL\,J0823.3-4248.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL\,J0823.4-4305 and 2FGL\,J0821.0-4254 which are part of the
extended source.  We tested the source for source confusion by fitting
it as two point sources. Because $\tsinc=22.1$ is smaller then \tsext,
we conclude that this is an extended source.  These modifications are
shown in figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248}.

This extended source is spatially coincident with the SNR Puppis A.
Overlaid on figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248} are ROSAT contours of Puppis
A (\cite{rosat_puppis_a}). There is good agreement between of the X-ray

% No modifications to background were needed

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1627.0-2425c was found 
using 1-100 \gev photons to have an 
extension of $0.41\deg\pm0.05\deg\stat\pm0.02\deg\sys$ 
with an extension significance of $\tsext=31.1$. 
The best fit position is $(l,b)=(353.08\deg, 16.78\deg)$.
This source is coincident with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J1628.6-2419c.
A counts map showing this source is
seen in figure \ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c}.  To test for source confusion,
we also fit the source instead as two point sources. Since $\tsinc=20.0$
is smaller than \tsext, we conclude that this is an extended source.

This source is in a region of remarkably complicated diffuse emission.
Even though it is 16\deg from the Galactic plane, the source is on top
of the core of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud which contains massive
star-forming regions that are bright in the infrared.  We have overlaid
on figure~\ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c} contours of the 100 micrometer infared
image of this region measured by IRAS. There is good spatial overlap
with the \gev emission (\cite{iras_rho_ophiuci}).

The region also has abundant molecular and atomic gas traced by CO
and HI but also plenty of dark gas, the kind that we find only by its
association with dust emission. Embedded star-forming regions make it even
more challenging to measure the column density of dust.  Although this
region is significantly extended, we conclude that this source most
likely represents inadequacy in the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission model.

\todo[inline]{Can we get another citation about dark gas and stuff?

further away catalog sources 2FGL\,J0858.0-4815 and 2FGL\,J0901.7-4655
because they were not significant above 10 \gev.  After modifying
the region, we found that \tsinc=16.1 which is less than \tsext so we

photons to have an extension of $0.33\deg\pm0.04\deg\stat\pm0.01\deg\sys$
with an extension significance of \tsext=16.3.  The source
was fit to a position of $(l,b)=(332.38\deg,-0.14\deg)$.
This source is coincident with the one year catalog source
1FGL\,J1613.6-5100c. Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c} shows a counts map
of this source.

This source is less than 1\deg away from 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 which is
also spatially extended (see section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}).
To get a good fit of both sources, we had to model both sources as
being spatially extended and iteratively fit the position and extension
of each source until obtaining a global best fit.  Before doing this,
We removed from our model the source 2FGL\,J1614.9-5212 because it is
part of 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138's. Furthermore, we removed the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL\,J1619.7-5040c and 2FGL\,J1620.6-5111c because they were not
significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications are further described
in the caption to figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.  After modifying
the region, we found that \tsinc=11.9 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1616-508 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}, contours of HESS\,J1616-508 are overlaid
on 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051.  The H.E.S.S. experiment measured a Gaussian
extension $0.136\pm 0.008$ when fitting the source with an elliptical
Gaussian spatial model.  This size corresponds to a 68\% containment
radius of $\rsixeight=0.21\deg\pm0.01\deg$. This size is comparable to the LAT
size $\rsixeight=0.27\deg\pm0.03\deg$ (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051
connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1616-508.

HESS\,J1616-508 is located in the region of two SNRs, RCW103 (G332.4-04)
and Kes 32 (G332.4+0.1) but is not spatially coincident with either
of them.  HESS\,J1616-508 is near three pulsars near PSR J1614-5048,
PSR J1616-5109, and PSR J1617-5055 but only PSR J1617-5055 only
PSR J1617-5055 is energetically favored as being the \tev emitter
(\cite{integral_HESS_J1616-508}).  \cite{hess_plane_survey}
speculated that this young pulsar could be responsible for the
emission of HESS\,J1616-508.  HESS\,J1616-508 is 9' away from PSR
J1617-5055, which was discovered during ASCA observations of RCW 103
(\cite{discovery_of_PSR_J1617-5055}). Using an outer gap magnetospheric
pulsar model, it was previously predicted to be a \tev emitter
(\cite{pulsar_tev_emission_predictions}).

The pulsar's position is offset from the maximum of the H.E.S.S
emission and would require an asymetric PWNe to power the \tev
emission. Offset PWN are expected on theoretical grounds due
to the PWNe being crushed by an asymmetric SNR reverse shock
(\cite{offset_pwn_ahronian,offset_pwn_blondin}) but this makes a
possible association more difficult.  For HESS\,J1825-137, the X-ray
emission is directed along the \tev offset making this association more
compelling.\cite{hess_j1825_hess}.


In the region around HESS\,J1616-508, Suzaku found only an upper limit
in the 2-10 \kev energy range and suggested this source as an example
of a ``dark particle accelerator'' (\cite{suzakzu_HESS_J1616-508}).
\cite{integral_HESS_J1616-508} found no evidence of hard X-ray emission
in the region of HESS\,J1616-508 in the 20-100 \kev energy band with the
IBIS/ISGRBI on board INTEGRAL. They also observed the field with the XRT
on board {\em Swift} between 0.2-10 \kev and found no compelling source
counterpart. Using archival XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX data, they found no
plausible X-ray counterpart except for PSR J1617-5055.

Finally, Chandra ACIS observations of PSR J1617-5055 revealed
an underlomonous PWN $\approx1'$ in size around the pulsar
(\cite{discovery_of_pwn_for_PSR_J1617-5055}). But the PWN is not
assymetric towards HESS\,J1616-508 which casts doubt upon the association.

\subsection{2FGL\,J1615.2-5138}
\label{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 was found using 10-100 \gev
photons to have an extension of $0.42\deg\pm0.03\deg\stat\pm0.01\sys$
with an extension significance of \tsext=48.0.  The source was fit to a
position of $(l,b)=(331.66\deg,-0.66\deg)$.  This source is coincident
with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J1614.7-5138c.  Because 2FGL
J1615.2-5138 is close to 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051, the same model described
in section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.0-5051} was used to analyze both
sources. Both sources can be seen in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.
For 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138, \tsinc=37.0 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1614-518 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}). In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}, contours of HESS\,J1614-518 are overlaid
on 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138.  The H.E.S.S. experiment measured a Gaussian
extension of $\sigma=0.23\deg\pm0.02\deg$ and $\sigma=0.15\pm0.02$
in the semi-major and semi-minor axis. This size corresponds
to a 68\% containment size of $\rsixeight=0.35\deg\pm0.03\deg$
and $0.23\pm0.03$.  This elliptical size matches the LAT size
$\rsixeight=0.35\deg\pm0.03\deg$.  Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that
the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S
spectrum of HESS\,J1614-518.  Further data collected by H.E.S.S. in 2007
helped to resolve a double peaked structure in the H.E.S.S. data but no
spectral variation across the source, suggesting that the emission is
not the confusion of physically separate sources (\cite{closer_look_hess_j1614-518}).
The source was also detected by CANGAROO-III (\cite{cangaroo_j1614-518}).

This source is currently unidentifed. There are five nearby pulsars,
but they are not luminous enough to provide the required energy output
to power the \tev emission (\cite{closer_look_hess_j1614-518}).

\todo[inline]{Swift observations}

Suzaku observations of the region around HESS\,J1614-518 reveale three
X-ray sources in the region. Suzaku source A is a hard extended source
spatially coincident with the peak of HESS\,J1614-518. 

Suzaku source B is
in a relativly dim region in the middle of HESS\,J1614-518 and was not
spatially resolvable. source B is spatially coincident with Pisim 22.

Suzaku Source C is a foreground source.

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c was found 
using 10-100 \gev photons to
have an extension of $0.44\deg\pm0.04\deg\stat\pm0.03\deg\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of \tsext=64.5.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(336.41\deg,0.22\deg)$.  This source is coincident with the one
year catalog source 1FGL\,J1632.9-4802c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}
shows a counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove from our model
three catalog sources 2FGL\,J1631.7-4720c, 2FGL\,J1630.2-4752,
2FGL J1634.4-4743c.4-4820c that were part of the extended source..
We then iteratively relocalized the source 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c
to $(l,b)=(337.230\deg,0.346\deg)$ and 2FGL\,J1636.3-4740c to
$(l,b)=(336.968\deg,-0.066\deg)$ while fitting the extension of
2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c.  In addition we removed from our model four
farther away two year catalog sources 2FGL\,J1638.0-4703c, 2FGL
J1628.1-4857c, 2FGL  J1630.1-4615, 2FGL\,J1639.8-4921c because they
were not significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications are shown
in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}.  To test for source confusion,
we compared the likelihood fitting this region as one extended source
to the likelihood fitting this region as two point sources. We found
$\tsinc=40.6$ which is less than \tsext so we conclude
that this is an extended source.

This extended source is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1632-478 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}, contours of  HESS\,J1632-478 are
overlaid on 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c.  H.E.S.S measured a Gaussian extension of
$\sigma=0.21\pm0.05$ and $0.06\pm0.04$ along the semi-major and semi-minor
axes when fitting the source with an elliptical Gaussian spatial model.
This corresponds to a 68\% containment size $\rsixeight=0.31\deg\pm0.08\deg$
and $0.09\pm0.06$ along the semi-major and semi-minor axis. This
size is consistent with the LAT size $\rsixeight=0.36\deg\pm0.04\deg$.
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c
connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1632-478 and most
likely corresponds to the same emission process

\cite{hess_plane_survey} argued that this source is positionally
coincident with the hard X-ray source IGR\,J1632-4751 discovered above
15 \kev by the INTEGRAL satellite (\cite{Igr_J16320-4751_circ}).
It was also observed by XMM-Newton between 2 and 10 \kev
(\cite{xmm_newton_IGR_J16320-4751}) and ASCI between 0.7 and 10 \kev
(\cite{asca_plane_survey}).  But this X-ray source is suspected to be
an galactic X-Ray Binary so the \gev and \tev extension HESS\,J1632-478
and 2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c disfavors the association.

Further observations of the region around HESS\,J1632-478 by XMM-Newton
reveal extended emission between 0.2 \kev and 15 \kev with an elliptical
size of $\approx32''$ and $\approx15''$ in the semi-major and semi-minor
axes and inside this extended emission was point-like emission
(\cite{hess_j1632_478_xmm_newton}).  This x-ray source is positionally
coincident with the \tev centroid of the H.E.S.S source.  In addition,
they used data from MGPS-2, an 843 MHz survey of the galactic plane
carried out with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST)
to detect an extended diffuse radio source whose size matches well the
extended X-ray emission \cite{most_survey_galactic_plane}.

They argued that the positional match between the radio and X-ray
observations argues for a single synchrotron processes emitting from
radio to X-ray.  This same source could be responsible for the \tev
emission due to inverse Compton and this matches the expected emission
from a typical PWNe.

The increased \gev and \tev size compared to the X-ray size
has previously been observed in several aging PWNe including 
HESS\,J1825-137 (\cite{hess_j1825_xmm_newton,hess_j1825_hess}, HESS\,J1640-465
(\cite{hess_plane_survey,xmm_newton_hess_j_1640-466}),
and Vela X (\cite{vela_x_rosat,vela_x_hess}). 
This can be explained by a different synchrotron cooling
time for the electroncs producing X-rays and \tev gamma rays.
Because of the spectral and spatial match between the \gev and \tev
emission, the LAT data naturally fits into this model as being the rising
edge of the inverse Compton component of a PWN.

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c was found 
with 10-100 \gev photons 
to have an extension
of $0.35\deg\pm0.08\deg\stat\pm0.03\deg\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of $\tsext=18.8$.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(25.08\deg,0.13\deg)$.  This source is coincident with the one
year catalog source 1FGL\,J1837.5-0659c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}
shows a counts map of this source.

This source is in a complicated region. There are three nearby
catalog sources 2FGL\,J1834.7-0705c, 2FGL\,J1836.8-0623c, and
2FGL\,J1839.3-0558c.  To get a good fit of 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c, we
relocalized 2FGL\,J1834.7-0705c to $(l,b)=(24.77\deg,0.50\deg)$,
2FGL\,J1836.8-0623c to $(l,b)=(25.57\deg,0.32\deg)$, and
2FGL\,J1839.3-0558c to $(l,b)=(26.08\deg,0.23\deg)$.  We removed the
nearby catalog source 2FGL\,J1835.5-0649 which is part of the extended
source and also the farther away catalog source 2FGL\,J1839.0-0539
because it was not significant above 10 \gev. These modifications are
shown in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}.  After modifying the region,
we found that \tsinc=12.6 which is less than \tsext, so we conclude that
the source is spatially extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the \tev
source HESS\,J1837-069 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}, contours of HESS\,J1837-069
are overlaid on 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c. H.E.S.S. measured a 
Gaussian extension
of $\sigma=0.12\pm0.02$ and $0.05\pm0.02$ along the semi-major and
semi-minor axis when fitting the source with an elliptical Gaussian
spatial model.  This corresponds to a 68\% containment radius of
$\rsixeight=0.18\deg\pm0.03\deg$ and $0.08\deg\pm0.03\deg$ along the semi-major
and semi-minor axis. The size is comparable to LAT which fit a 68\%
containment radius of $\rsixeight=0.29\deg\pm0.07\deg$.  The LAT size is larger
than the H.E.S.S. size but the sizes are almost almost within the
$1\sigma$ errors. Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum
of 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of
HESS\,J1837-069.

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J2021.5+4026 was found with 10-100 \gev
photons to have an extension of $0.59\deg\pm0.03\deg\stat\pm0.02\deg\sys$
with an extension significance of $\tsext=116.4$.  The source was
fit to a position of $(l,b)=(78.18\deg,2.19\deg)$.  This source
is coincident with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J2020.0+4049.
Figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049} shows a counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
source 2FGL\,J2019.1+4040 which were part of the extended source.
Further, we found it necessary to add an additional point source not in
the two year catalog into our background model.  The new source is was
localized to a position of $(l,b)=(78.85\deg,2.67\deg)$ and had $\ts=13.5$ .
Although the source is not very significant, not including it into the
background model appeared visually to significantly throw off the fit
of the region.  In addition, we removed the four further away catalog
sources 2FGL\,J2022.8+3843c, 2FGL\,J2020.0+4159, 2FGL\,J2013.8+4115c,
and 2FGL\,J2012.4+3955c from the region because they were not significant
above 10 \gev.  After modifying the region, we found that \tsinc=24.3
which is less than \tsext, so we believe that this source is spatially
extended.  These modifications are further described in the caption to
figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049}.

This source is spatially coincident with the Gamma Cygni SNR.  Contours of
Gamma Cygni at 408MHz from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey are overlaid
on figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049} and there is good spatial agreement
with the LAT emission (\cite{canadian_galactic_plane_survey}).

Add interpretations paragraph.  Describe how this source will be more

\section{Discussion}

\todo[inline]{Finish the discussion.}

2FGL reported on the detection of twelve spatially extended sources. Using
two years of LAT data and a new analysis method, we present on 
the detection of nine additional extended sources. We also reanalyze
the spatial shape of the extended sources in 2FGL.  Finding a coherent
source extension with different frequencies, especially at \tev energies,
allows us to identify the LAT source. Even still, for many extended LAT
sources the source class and emission process is still uncertain.

The position of the 21 extended LAT sources is plotted in
figure~\ref{allsky_extended_sources}.  Most of them lie along the galactic
plane.  This is expected because extragalactic sources are typically too
far away to be resolvable and most Galactic sources lie along the plane.


Figure~\ref{compare_index_2FGL} shows a comparison of the spectral index
of LAT detected extended sources and of all sources in 2FGL. This, and
table~\label{known_extended_sources} and~\label{new_ext_srcs_table},
show that the LAT observes a population of hard (index $<2$)
extended sources above 10 \gev which connects to \tev sources.
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows the LAT energy spectrum of four of the
extended sources which were first discovered in the H.E.S.S. Galactic
plane survey (\cite{hess_plane_survey}) and have a matching size to LAT
extended sources.  The LAT energy spectrum connects smoothly to \tev.
This is also true of HESS\,J1825-137 (\ref{fermi_hess_j1825}) and RX
J1713.7-3946 (\cite{rx_j1713_lat}). We conclude that the \gev and \tev
emission from these sources is coming from the same emission mechanism.

For the LAT extended sources also seen in \tev,
figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_plot} shows a comparison of their sizes.  There is
a good correlation between the \gev and \tev sizes of the sources. Even
so, the size of PWNe are expected to vary across the \gev and \tev energy
range and the size of HESS\,J1825-137 was seen by H.E.S.S. to vary
between 200 \gev and 20 \tev (\cite{energy_dependent_hess_j1825}).
HESS\,J1825-137 is significantly larger in \gev than \tev
(\cite{fermi_hess_j1825}).  It is interesting to compare the \gev and
\tev size of other PWN candidates, but definitively measuring this effect
would require a more careful analysis of the LAT data using the same 
elliptical spatial model.

Figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_histogram} compares the size of the 21 extended
LAT sources to the 42 extended H.E.S.S. sources.  Because of the large
field of view and all sky coverage, the LAT can more easily measure
larger sources including the LMC and SMC.  On the other hand, the
smaller angular resolution of Air Cherenkov detectors allows them to
measure a population of extended sources below our sensitivity limit
(currently at about $\approx0.2\deg$).  Fermi has a five year nominal
livetime with a goal of ten years of operation. With increased exposure,
the LAT will likely begin to resolving these smaller \tev sources.

Furthermore, our sensitivity to these extended sources will likely improve
faster than $\sqrt{t}$ because at the highest energies, our background is
relatively small and we are in the Poisson instead of Gaussian limit.
Future improvements in the diffuse emission model will improve our
sensitivity by allowing this analysis to go to lower energies.

    The $x$ axis is \tsext and the $y$ axis is the cumulative density
    for \tsext of simulated point sources. The four plots represent
    different spectral indices and the different colors represent
    different fluxes.  The dashed red line is the cumulative density
    function of $\chi^2(\ts)/2$ which is suggested by Wilks' theorem
    as the distribution these curves should should follow.  There is
    good agreement between the Monte Carlo results and
    the theoretical distribution. For most spectral parameters, the
    Monte Carlo curve lies to the left of the theoretical curve which
    would make the theoretical distribution more conservative.  In this
    paper, we use this theoretical curve to estimate the significance of
    the detection of a source's extension. This plot cuts off 
    three simulations with $\tsext>25$. They 
    had a flux $3\times10^{-8}\ph/\cm^2/\sec$, spectral index

    This plot shows the detection threshold to resolve a uniform
    disk extended source.  The detection threshold is defined as the flux where
    $\langle\tsext\rangle=16$ for a given extension.  The $x$ axis is
    the extension of a uniform disk extended source and the $y$ axis
    is the source's 100 \mev to 100 \gev photon flux.  All sources have
    an assumed power-law spectrum and the different colors are different
    simulated spectral indices.  The solid line is the detection threshold
    using photons with energy between 100 \mev and 100 \gev while the
    dashed line is the threshold using photons with energy between 1 \gev
    and 100 \gev.  The detection threshold is for the same two year time
    range as was used in 2FGL and in the following extended source search.
    The extended sources are simulated against
  a Sreekumar-like isotropic background.  More information
    about this plot is presented in section~\ref{extension_sensitivity}.
    This plot shows that our threshold to detecting the extension of
    a source is best for a source with size $~0.5\deg$. It also shows
    that for sources neither too large nor soft, our sensitivity is not
    significantly improved using photons with energy between 100 \mev

    This shows the detection threshold to a uniform disk extended
    source for varying background levels
    and energy ranges.  The plots have the same meaning as in
    figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} and the simulations occur over the
    same time range.  The solid blue line is the detection threshold against a
    Sreekumar-like isotropic background. The green dashed curve is the
    threshold against 10 times the isotropic background and the dash
    dotted red curve is the threshold against 100 times the isotropic
    background.  The latter factor approximately represents the intensity
    of the Galactic diffuse emission near the Galactic center.  Plot (a)
    is the threshold using photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100
    \gev while plot (b) is the threshold using photons with energies
    between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. Unlike figure~\ref{index_sensitivity},
    the detection threshold was calculated only for a power-law source of spectral
    index 2. The flux is quoted only in the selected energy range which
    weakens the dependence of the detection threshold on spectral index.
    These plots show that we are less sensitive to extended sources in
    regions with higher background and (given the same number of photons)
    more sensitive to harder sources.  Overlaid on this plot are the
    extended sources found in this extended source search. The extended
    sources are color coded based upon whether the integral galactic
    diffuse and isotropic diffuse emission model is closer to 1x, 10x,
    or 100x the Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum.  The red point
    in plot (a) below the red line is RX J1713.7-3946 which is harder
    ($\gamma\approx1.5$) and has diffuse emission only 53 times larger
    than the isotropic emission.  The green point in plot (b) below
    the green line is MSH 15-52 which was found by our analysis to
    have $\tsext=6.5$.  More information about this plot is presented

      \caption{For the new extended source candidates
      in table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}, we describe the
      results of the dual localization procedure described in
      section~\ref{dual_localization_method}. Here, the extended
      source candidate is not fit as an extended source but instead
      fit as two point sources.  The dual localization is performed
      with \pointlike and results in the best fit position of the two
      sources $(\glon_1,\glat_1)$ and $(\glon_2,\glat_2)$.  The change
      in likelihood and spectral values are then computed using \gtlike
      with the best fit positions found by \pointlike.  \tsinc is the
      increase in TS fitting the region as two sources compared to
      fitting compared to fitting a single point source and is computed
      using \gtlike with the best fit positions taken from \pointlike.
      It can be directly compared to \tsext, which is taken from
      table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  For all of our candidates, $\tsext
      > \tsinc$ which shows that an extended source fits the source better
      than two point sources.  As in table~\ref{known_extended_sources},
      flux is measured in units of $10^{-9}\ph/\cm^2/\sec$ and is the
      integral flux between 1 \gev (10 \gev) and 100 \gev for the sources
      found using photons above 1 \gev (10 \gev).}

    The \tev extensions of MSH 15-52, HESS\,J1825-137, Vela X,
    Vela Jr., RX J1713.7-3946 and W28 are respectively from H.E.S.S.

    The LAT extension of Vela X is from (\cite{velax}).  Except for RX
    J1713.7-3946 Vela Jr., the \tev sources were fit with a Gaussian
    spatial model so the plotted \gev and \tev extensions were first
    converted to \rsixeight (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
    Because of their large size, the RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr.
    were not directly fit in \tev. The \tev radius of RX J1713.7-3946
    is taken to be 0.5\deg and Vela Jr. to be 1\deg and the LAT size
    is not converted to \rsixeight. The LAT extension errors are
    the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature. This
    plot shows that there is a correlation between the \gev and \tev
    sizes of sources.  The \tev size of MSH 15-52, HESS\,J1614-518,
    HESS\,J1632-478, and HESS\,J1837-069 have only been reported with
    an elliptical Gaussian fit and so the plotted size is the average

      \caption{The detection threshold to resolve a uniform disk spatially
      extended sources using two years of data for sources of varying
      spectral index and extension against varying background levels
      with different energy ranges.  The upper table is the sensitivity
      when using photons with energies from 1-100 \gev and the bottom
      table is when using 10-100 \gev photons. The first column is
      the extended source's spectral index.  The extended sources
      were simulated against a Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum and
      the second column is the factor that the simulated background
      was scaled by. The remaining columns are varying sizes of the
      source's spatial model. The table quotes fluxes in units of
      $10^{-10} \ph/\cm^2/\sec$.  These values are also plotted in
      figure~\ref{all_sensitivity}.  More information about this
      table is presented in section~\ref{extension_sensitivity}.
