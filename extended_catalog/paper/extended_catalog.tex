\section{Introduction}

% * Resolving spatially extended Fermi sources is important for 
%    * studying supernova remnants, 
%    * pulsar wind nebulae, 
%    * galaxies,  
%    * potentially dark matter or new physics.

% * Systematic test for a certain kind of (~ small) regularly shaped extended 

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair conversion telescope on the
Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. It has been surveying the $\gamma$-ray
sky since June 2008.  Fermi is particularly well suited as a survey
instrument because of its to survey the broad energy coverage (20 \mev
to >300 \gev), a wide field of view ($\sim 2.4 \sr$) and large effective
area ($\sim 8000 \cm^2$ at $>1 \gev$).

Using one year of all sky monitoring, the LAT published a catalog of
source that were significantly resolved.  Many of these sources could
be be associated with a variety of source classes including active
galactic nuclei, pulsars, galaxies, and supernova remenants.  Many of
these source classes can be spatially resolved when observed at other
frequencies and could possibly be spatially resolvable by the LAT.

In particular, the LAT has discovered a variety of spatially extended
supernova remnants including IC443 and W51C (\cite{ic443,w51c}) and pulsar
wind nebulae (\cite{msh1552,velax}). And there are other source classes
which could possibly be spatially resolved by the LAT including galaxy
clusters, dark matter, and possibly new physics.

Furthermore, a variety of spatially extended but otherwise unassociated
sources have been detected in the galacitc plane at \tev energies using
Air Cherenkov detectors. Most prominent was a survey of the galaictc
plane using H.E.S.S which discovered 14 spatially extended sources
(\cite{HESS_plane_survey}).

Being able to spatially resolve a fermi source is important for several
reasons. Most importantly, the spatial morphology can be used to help
identify a Fermi source. Because of the large point spread function (PSF),
for any source there are often several counterparts which it could be
associated with. Finding a matching morphology can uniquly identify the
source emitting the $\gamma$-rays. 

Because of the largely varying PSF of the LAT, the spatial and spectral
model of a source do not nicely decouple and spatially resolving a Fermi
source is also important for obtaining an unbiased spectral model of
the source.  Furthermore, using this extension information is important
for improved the overall model of the sky which is important for obtaining
a better fit of nearby sources and removing spurious point sources which
we might otherwise think we detect.

Nevertheless, morphological studies of sources in the \gev energy range
using the Fermi LAT is challenging because of the significantly energy
dependent PSF and because of systematic errors in the galactic diffuse
emission.  The Fermi PSF is determinted at lower energies by multiple
scatteering in the tracker The 68\% containment radius of the PSF is
approximatly 5.1\deg at 100 \mev  when averaged over instrumetn acceptance
and including photons which convert in either the thick or thin layers of
the tracker.  The PSF approaches a limit given by the granularity of the
tracker channeles and is 0.14\deg at 10 \gev (\cite{on_orbit_calibration}).
Therefore, the higher energy photons are significantly more important for
resolving a source but there are typically fewere of them.  So a detailed
maximum likelihood analysis must be used to maximize our sensitivity.

\section{Analysis Method}

\subsection{The \pointlike Package}

A new analysis tool has been developed to address the unique requirements
for studying spatially extended sources with the Fermi LAT. The tool
implements a maximum likelihood analysis where the Poisson likelihood
for observing the measured counts is computed for a particular sky
model. The parameters of the sky model are then fit by maximizing the log
of the likelihood.  To study the extension of a source, one can assume
a particular shape for an extended source (e.g. a disk or Gaussian),
and fit the spatial parameters of that source.

In principle, the entire task can be done using the official maximum
likelihood tool \gtlike which is distributed publically by the Fermi
Science Support Center\cite{fssc}.  But \gtlike is only able to fit the
spectral parameters of the source, so the extension fitting would have
to be done as an external loop. Typically, the run time for a binned
source analysis using \gtlike is several hours so this loop would be
especially time consuming. In principle, parallel computing could ease
this burdon, but parallel fitting algorithms are rather untested and
complex. Furthermore, the machinery required to do something like this
would necessarily be rather complex. What has typically been done by
the Fermi team to study extended sources is to fix the assumed position
of the extended source, either by our knowledge of a source from other
wavelenghts, or by fitting it as a point source. Then, a profile of the
likelihood as a function of extension is developed using \gtlike and the
maximum of this profile. This approach is not optimal because it needs
not be the case that the best fit position of a point source would be
the same as the best fit position of an extended source. Furthermore, by
not fully maximizing the likelihood, this method is not as significant to
extension, especially of faint sources. And finally, since this approach
is so computationally intensive, no large scale Monte Carlo effort has
been launched to validate the method.

Instead, an alternate approach was developed for performing a
morphological analysis. An alternate maximum likelihood fitting package
called \pointlike has been developed by the Fermi collaboration and we
have expanded its functionality to fully support analyzing spatially
extended sources. \pointlike is most thoroughly described in Matthew
Kerr's Ph.D Thesis but the important aspects will be summarized below
(\cite{matthew_kerr_thesis}) . What differentiates \pointlike most
significantly from \gtlike is its emphasis on speed by introducing
approximations into the calculation of the likelihood function while
at the same time trying to reduce any numerical errors that may
be introduced.  Like binned \gtlike, \pointlike bins the sky both in
position and energy.  Unlike \gtlike, \pointlike relies on the {\em
healpix} representation of spatial bins\cite{healpix} and scales the
size of each spatial bin to be smaller than the PSF. This is convenient
because it no significant information is lost due to binning at all
energies and it is always a good approximation that the model predicted
counts are uniform across a spatial bin.

\pointlike additionaly bins the Fermi $\gamma$-rays by their conversion
type, which corresponds to whether the photon converted in the front or
back part of the detector. Since the PSF is smaller for front entering
photons, one would expect binning each conversion type independently to
improve our sensitivity.

Furthermore, \pointlike uses a sparse matrix representation of the spatial
bins where only the bins with counts in them are looped over. The only
downside to this is that the integral of the model predicted counts
must be independently calculated.  Effectively, \pointlike efficiently
interpolates from a totally binned analysis at low energy (where the
resolution is poor and there are many counts) to an unbinned analysis
at high energy (where the resolution is very good but there are few
counts). This approach provides a significant savings in time while
introducing only small numerical error.

Finally, \pointlike is written mostly in the \python programming language
using numpy and scipy to vectorize most of the computations. This provides
a reasonable tradeoff between computational efficiency and quickness of
development time. And by leaving the interface to use \pointlike as a
series of \python modules, advanced functions including extension fittion
described in section~\ref{extesion_fitting} and the dual localization
procedure described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method} could
quickly be build on top of the core modules.

\subsection{Extension Fitting}
\label{extension_fitting}

We have modified \pointlike to support fitting spatially extended sources.
To do this, we introduced a new class of diffuse sources where the spatial
and spectral information completely decouple and where the spatial shape
is parameters by simple shapes.  The code consistently convolves the
extended source shape with the point spread function (as a function
of energy) and integrates the spectrum over energy to computed model
predicted counts.

Finally, \pointlike allows the spatial parameters of an extended source
to be simulataneoulsy fit. \pointlike uses the \minuit fitting library to
perform the maximum likelihood maximization of the position and extension
of an extended source (\cite{minuit_documentation}).  At each step in
the fit of the shape, the spectral parameters of the entire sky model
are reoptimized. To avoid projection effects, what is directly fit is
not the longitude and latitude of the source but instead the displacement
in a rotated reference frame.


\pointlike optimizes the analysis of extended sources in two ways.  First,
for extended sources which are radially symmetric, the convolution of
the source shape with our parameterization of the PSF can be performed
semi-analytically. Generally, at a given energy the observed photon
distribution is
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(\vec r) = \int  \text{PSF}(|\vec r - \vec r'|)I_\text{src}(\vec r') d A' 
\end{equation}
where $I_\text{src}$ is the extended soruce shape and the PSF is parameterized by
\begin{equation}
  \text{PSF}(\vec r) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}
  \left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left(1+\frac{u}{\gamma}\right)^{-\gamma}
\end{equation}
Here, $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ are parameterize the $PSF$.  If the extended
source is radially symmetric, then $I_\text{src} (\vec r') = I_\text{src}
(r')$ and the angular part of the integral can be done analytically,
leaving a simpler one dimensional integral:
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(u)= \int_0^\infty dv
  I_\text{src}(v) 
  \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma + u + v}\right)^\gamma 
  \times ~_2F_1 \left(\gamma/2,\frac{1+\gamma}{2},1,\frac{4uv}{(\gamma+u+v)^2}\right)
\end{equation}
Not only is this convolution formula faster, but it has the advantage that
it more accurately reduces to the actual PSF shape as the source's size
decreases.  Decreasing the numerical difference between a small extended
source and the PSF is important when searching for smaller extended
sources and when determining the statistical significance of a detection.

There is one final approximation which speeds up the convolution.
Generally, the PSF is a function of the angle $\theta$ of the incident
event measured relative to the normal to the LAT. To avoid repeatedly
convolving the source shape with the PSF at a series of $\theta$ angles,
an effective PSF is fit to the weighted sum of the PSF times the exposure
at different $\theta$ angles.  Since the source convolution has to be
done at each fit iteration, these optimization were essential for making
this tool fast enough for the following analysis. Typically, the entire
process of fitting the extension and estimating the errors for a source
would run on the order of an hour.

\subsection{Extension Errors}

Errors on fit parameters are typically calculated in one of two
ways. The first method requires explicilty varying one paramter until
the log of the likelihood has fallen by a value 1/2 while simulatenously
optimizing the other fit parmaeters.  \minuit provides the {\em Simplex}
function to calculate errors this way (\cite{minuit_documentation}).
The second method involves estimating the likelihood function as being
a multivariate gaussian and calcluating the curvature of the log of
the likelihood at the peak to estimate when the function will fall by
a value 1/2. \minuit provides the {\em HESSE} algorithm to calcualte
errors this way.  The {\em HESSE} are significantly faster but make the
approximation that the log of the likelihood is perfectly gaussian.

We found that although much faster, the {\em HESSE} algorithm would
somtimes grosely understimate the errors on the localization and extension
of the source.  On the other hand, we found the {\em Simplex} algorithm
was computationally very slow and would often run into convergence
problems and fail to get reasonable errors.

As a compromise, we employed a hybrid approach to calculate
the localization and extension errors in \pointlike by making the
approximation that the covariance between the extension and location of
the source was small. On the other hand, we do not necessarily expect the
likelihood profile to be Gaussian when varying the source's extension.
So we calculate the error on the extension by fixing the position of the
source and then explicitly using {\em Simplex} to vary the extension of
the source until the log of the likelihood has fallen by 1/2.

Then, the extended source's position error is calculated using the
same code employed to calculate position errors of point sources. This
code is used to calculate the localization error of all point sources
kn the catalog\cite{second_cat}. It works by fitting an ellipse to the
likelihood surface near the maximum and using this fit ellipse to estimate
an elliptical localization errors. By reporting two localization errors
as well as a localization error angle, this method explicitly takes care
of covariance between the two position coordinates.

\subsection{Gtlike Crosscheck}

Because of its computational speed, \pointlike is especially well
optimized for analysis that requires many iterations. This include
source localization, extension fitting, source finding, building test
statistic maps, and model comparison. On the other hand, \pointlike's
efficiency has to entail some loss of precision and so it is generally
expected that \gtlike will produce a more precise result.  Furthermore,
because it is the standard likelihood analysis package, \gtlike has been
more extensively validated and is very well trusted.

For that reason, we take our best fit source model obtained by
\pointlike with the best fit positions and extensions and refit the
spectral parameters of the model using \gtlike.  \gtlike provides a
second calculation of the likelihood which can then be used to obtain
for any source a second measure of \ts and \tsext.

We find very good agreement between the two methods. For the new extended
source candidates, Table \ref{alt_diff_model_results} shows a comparison
of \ts and \tsext computed using \pointlike and \gtlike. For the rest
of this paper, unless otherwise mentioned all \ts, \tsext, flux, and
spectral index values were obtained using \gtlike with the localization
results found by \pointlike.

\subsection{Dual Localization}
\label{dual_localization_method}

There is a degeneracy in the signal expected from spatially extended
sources and multiple point sources.  To assess the possibility of source
confusion, we developed a function in pointlike for simulatenously fitting
two point sources so that the likelihood fitting two point sources
could be compared to the likelihood fitting one extended source.

The algorithm works by first dividing the selected point source into
two separate sources. Then, the position of the two sources 
are fit simultanously. To avoid projection effects, the fit is
done in a coordiante system rotated to the celestial equator.
In this rotated coordiante system, space can be well approximated
as being flat and we are interested in fitting the 
rotated coordiante $(x_1',y_1')$ and $(x_2',y_2')$
We decided not to directly fit the positions of the two sources 
but instead the fit sum and difference of the rotated coordiantes
$S_x=(x_2'+x_1')/2$, $S_x=(y_2'+y_1')/2$, $D_x=(x_2'-x_1')/2$, and $D_y=(y_2'-y_1')/2$.
We believe that fitting the average of position and the difference
independently would cause less degeneracy in the fit and help the fitter
find the best position.

For a particular value of $S_x$, $S_y$, $D_x$, and $D_y$, the Poisson
likelihood is computed by converting the sum and difference coordinates
into the rotated coordiantes, unrotating the coordiantes, moving the
two sources in the \pointlike to the new positions, and performing a new
spectral analysis at the modified position.  The function then maximizes
The Poission likelihood $L(S_x,S_y,D_x,D_y)$ as a function of the sum
and difference of the rotated coordaintes using the Minuit to fit the
sum and differenc coordiantes (\cite{minuit_documentation}).

After the minimization converges, we can define the parameter $\tsext$
as twice the increase in log likelihood between fitting the region with
two point sources and fitting the region with one point source
\begin{equation}
  \tsext=2\times(LL_\text{ext}-LL_\text{ps}).
\end{equation}
Generally, \tsinc can be directly compared to \tsext to see wheter two
point sources are prefered over one extended source. Unfortunatly,
performing a likelihood ratio test between two unnested models
is not a calibrated test and so there is no straightforward way
to convert the change in likelihood into a significance~\ref{
http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201547 }. Nevertheless, we find this
ratio, at least in the extreme case where $\tsinc \ll \tsext$ or
$\tsinc\gg\tsext$ to be suggestive. For all the spatally extended
candidates found, we computed both \tsext and \tsinc.

Because of \pointlike's computational efficiency, this algorithm
runs in a reasonable amount of time.

\subsection{Comparing Source Sizes}

\todo{This Section Needs Work}

When running \pointlike, we have to pick a spatial model for an extended
source. Our spatial model is then convolved with the PSF to create the
probability density function (PDF) that is is fit to the obersved counts.
Possible choices for spatial models include a Two dimensional gaussian
source (defined as a Gaussian in $x$ times a Gaussian in $y$):
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}\exp\left(-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma^2\right)
\end{equation}
or a uniform disk:
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{\pi\sigma^2}\delta\left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}<\sigma\right).
\end{equation}

Although these shapes look significantly different from eachother, the
convolution of these spatial models of typtical sizes with the PSF will
produce PDFs that are very similar.

This is demonstrated in figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss}.  The plot shows
(in black) the PSF that would be observed for a source of spectral
index 2. The dashed red (blue) line shows the probabability density
function for a Gaussian (uniform disk) of width $0.5\deg$.  The solid
red (blue) line shows the probability density function for the same
Gaussian (uniform disk) convolved with the PSF of an index 2 source.
figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss} shows the analysis using an energy range
betewen 1 \gev and 100 \gev whereas the right plot shows an analysis using an
energy range from 10 \gev to 100 \gev.

This plot shows that significantly different extended source shapes
look very similar after smearing with the PSF. The convolved shape of
the disk and Gaussian admittedly do look more different when restrict
ourselves to higher energy where the PSF is narrower, but we do not
excpet to have much luch learning about the exact nature of the
extended source shape. For that reason, in this paper we always use
the uniform disk spatial model to emphaizie our ignorance to the true
shape of the extended sources we are studying.

To get the convolved disk and Gaussian models looked so similar in
figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss}, we had to pick the extension of the two
sources so that they each predicted a 68\% containment radius of 0.5\deg.

The 68\% containment radius for a spatial model is
the radius at which 68\% of the intensity is enclosed.
It can be computed by a straightforward integral and we
find that $\rsixeight_\text{,disk}=0.82\sigma$ whereas
the $\rsixeight_\text{,Gaussian}=1.51\sigma$. Therefore, in
figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss} the uniform disk has an extension
of $\sigma=0.41\deg$ whereas the Gaussian has an extension of
$\sigma=0.75\deg$. Even though these sources have quite different
values of the extension $\sigma$, they look almost identical when convolved
with the PSF.

Finally, we note that comparing observed morphologies to 
counts maps can be misleading.  This effect can best be seen
in figure~\ref{compare_r68} where we have simulted a
extended source with 
a spatial model that is a uniform disk of extension 0.5\deg,
integral flux between 1 \gev and 100 \gev of $3e-8\ph/\cm^2/s$,
and a spectral index of 2. 

To reduce Poisson noise, figure~\ref{compare_r68} shows a counts map of
this simulated source smoothed with a 0.1\deg Gaussain kernel.  Overlaied
on the plot is the results of fitting this simulated source with a uniform
disk and a Gaussian spatial model.  The solid white line represents the
fit extension $\sigma_\text{disk}=0.496$ for the disk which was found to
be in very good agreemen with the simulated value.  The solid black line
represenst the fit extension $\sigma$ for the Gaussian which was found to
be $\sigma_\text{Gaussian}=0.2627$.  The white dashed line is the 68\%
containment radius of the fit Disk shape and the black dashed line is
the 68\% containment radius of the fit Gaussian shape.  Even though the
fit $\sigma$ for the disk and uniform Gaussian are different, the fit
68\% continment radius are very similar ($\rsixeight_\text{,disk}=0.41$
whereas $\rsixeight_\text{,Gaussian}=0.40$).

There are three important conclusions to take from this. The first is
that depending upon what spatial model you pick and what parameter you
choose to overlay on the smoothed counts ($\sigma$ or $rsixeight$),
you will get very different looking shapes even though the all lead
to a PDF which is very similar. And since we are not very sensitive
to the particular morphology of extended sources that we are seeing,
there is no correct choice for which shape to use. For the following
analysis, we always use a uniform disk as our spatial model because
of its conceptual simplicity and to emphasize our ignorance to the
true morphology. And for subsequent smoothed counts maps, we overlay
the $\sigma$ because that shows directly the edge of the shape we fit.
But due to smearing of the PSF, it has the unfotunatly concequence that
the extended source shape always (including in the simulated image)
looks larger than in the counts map.

The second conclusion we make is that because a counts map is smeared
out by the PSF and depends strongly on the particular color bar used, it
is very difficult to determine directly from a counts map a reasonable
spatial model that fits the data.  It is much better to obtain the
spatial model by a direct fit of a spatial parameters of a selected
model to the data.  The third conclusion we make is that when comparing
fit extensions to those at other wavelenghts (espeically in \tev), it is
important to compare fits of consistent spatial models. If this is not
possible, it is impotant to at least compare indirectly the $rsixeight$
for the different spatial models.


\section{LAT Extended Source Validation}

We validated \pointlike for extended source
analysis using a series of Monte Carlo studies.

\subsection{Significance of Extension}

To calculate the statistical significance of the extension of a source,
one can define a parameter $\tsext$ as twice the increase in log
likelihood between fitting a source with a spatially extended hypothesis
and a point hypothesis:
\begin{equation}
  \tsext=2\times(LL_\text{ext}-LL_\text{ps}).
\end{equation}
Of course, these are nested hypotehsis since a point sources is just an
extended source in the limit that the extension goes to 0. So since we
are just adding a paramter, it should always be true that $\tsext > 0$
We would expect that if we were really testing a point source that
\tsext would not be very large since a point model would fit about
as good as anytthing else. Therefore, we can consider a source to be
extended (and reject the null hyopthesis) if \tsext is large enough.
Since going from fitting a point soue to fitting a simple extended
source introduces only one degree of freedom (the source's extension)
Wilks' Theorem says that the distribution of $\tsext$ wen testin
point sources should follow a $\chi^2_1$ distribution with one degree
of freedom (\cite{wilks_theorem}).

On the other hand, since the null hypothesis rests on the edge of
parameter space, when the extension is fixed to 0, Wilks' Theorem does
not formally hold (\cite{warn_wilks_theorem}).  One might
expect the actual distribution to be a half $\chi^2_1$ distribution with
one degree of freedom plus half of a delta function at 0:
\begin{equation}
  P(\ts)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\chi^2_1(\ts)+\delta(\ts)).
\end{equation}
Chernoff proved that given certain assumtipons, this is
the ditribution that would hold when the null hypothesis
lies on the edge of parameter space for a particular parameter~\ref{chernof}.
The false detection probability can be estimated by integrating this function 
from an observed test statistic value to infinity. It is for this
particular distribution that the often quoted result holds that
$\sqrt{\ts}$ is a measure of the number of $\sigma$ of the detection.

It should be noted that Wilks' Theorem only holds when the likelihood
is maximized simultaneoulsy fitting all of the parameters of model. It
is for this reason why \pointlike goes through such great effort to
simultaneously fit the position, extension, and spectral paramters of
a source.

The half $\chi^2_1$ distribution was found by a Monte Carlo study
to hold for the special case of source finding of EGRET sources using the
maximum likelihood technique.  They were comparing the hypothesis of a
source to the hypothesis of just a background\cite{mattox_egret}.
Their argument for why this null hypothesis distribution was reasonable
was that half of the time, statistical underfluctuations would cause
there to be fewer fewer photons then expected where the sources is being
tested. Since the maximim likelihood machinery cannot fit negative
sources (which would lead to negative model predicted for which the
poisson likelihood is undefined), half of the tests would not have the
likelihood improved by adding a source to the model and $\ts=0$.
It is for the case that the null distribution has 

It seems plausable that a similar situation could happen when testing
a source for extension. Half of the time, statistical flucutations might
make the observed counts narrower thant the point spread function and
the likelhood would not improve by fitting the source with an extended
hypothesis. We tested this hypothesis below using a dedicated monte
carlo study.

One issue that we found when testing this analysis method is that
despite our best efforts, there was always a small discrepancy between
the likelihood value when fitting the source as a point source and when
fitting it as an extended source with a small extension.  This is to be
expected due to numerical innacuracies introduced by the convolution.
For most cases, this error is insignificant. It would not significanlty
bias any of the fit values or errors. But it would bias the distribution
of $\tsext$ in the null hypothesis. To correct for this,
instead of computing the likelihood in the null hypothesis by fitting
a point source, a new source model was introduced which is an extended
source with its extension fixed to a very small value. $LL_\text{ps}$
is then calculated by refitting this source using the same extended
source fitting code. It was only after introducing this change that we
were able to get broad agreement between simulations and Wilks' theorem.


\subsection{Monte Carlo Validation} \label{monte_carlo_validation}

We performed a dedicated Monte Carlo study to validate \pointlike for
studying spatially extended sources and also to demonstrate that we can
use $\tsext$ as a test of the statistical significance
of a source's extension.  The Monte Carlo study involved simulating point
sources of varying spectral models on top of a simulated background. The
simulated point source was then fit using \pointlike as both an extended
source and a point source and $\tsext$ was calculated.

Fermi LAT data was simulated using program \gtobssim which is
distributed publically by the Fermi Science Support Center
(\cite{fssc}).  The sources were simulated with a powerlaw spectral
model with 6 Were given 6 $>100$ \mev fluxes ranging from $3\times 10^{-9}
\ph/\cm^2/s$ to $10^{-6} \ph/\cm^2/s$.  The sources were then simulated
with spectral index ($\gamma$) values of 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3.  These
values were picked to probe a representative range measurable values.
For particular spectral indices, only the fluxes which would create a
statistically significant source detection ($\ts>25$) where selected,
since we are only interested in testing for extension sources with a
significant extent. The sources were simulated on top of an isotropic
powerlaw background with a Sreekumar-like spectrum ($>100$ \mev flux
of 1.5e-5 and spectral index 2.1) (\cite{sreekumar_isotropic}).

The Monte Carlo simulation was perforormed over a one year time interval using
a default rocking profile and an assumed a represntative
livetime fraction of 0.8.
The reconstruction was performed with photons from an energy range of
1 \gev to 100 \gev using 4 energy bins per decade and using the Pass 7 Version 6
source instrument response function (IRFs) to be consistent with the following analysis.

For most of the spectral models, over 10,000 statistically independent simulations were performed.
For fainter sources, some of the simulated sources, statistical flucatuations
caused the source to be not significant and they were excluded from the following analysis.
Table~\ref{ts_ext_num_sims} shows the parametesr used in the simualtion,
the number of simulations perfromed, and the average test statistic value.

The results of the Monte Carlo simulation are shown in
figure~\ref{ts_ext_mc}.  The cumulative density function (CDF) is plotted
against $\tsext$ For reference, the CDF for $\chi^2_1/2$,
suggested by Wilks' Theorem, is also plotted for comparison. Overall,
there is good agreement between Wilks' theorem, although the agreement is
not perfect.  It should be noted that the discrepancy seems to be worst
for bright sources which seems to imply that numerical errors in the
way \pointlike models the PSF and performs the convolution become more
apparent for sufficiently bright sources.  Other possible reasons for
departure from Wilks' theorem might include \pointlike ignoring energy
dispersion. Energy dispersion will change the shape as a function of
energy. \pointlike may also run into possibly problems with the fitting
algorithm getting stuck in false minimum. It is important to emphasize
that if
our emperical curve lies to the left of the curve we assume to estimate
significance, we would underestimate the statistical significance of
our result. Since this is the case for most of our simluations, we are
reasonable confident that $\sqrt{\tsext}$ can be safely
used as a measure of the statistical significance of a source's extension.

\section{Extended Source Sensitivity}\label{extension_sensitivity}

We performed another Monte Carlo study to determine the Fermi LAT's
sensitivity to spatially extended sources. The sensitivity to extension
is defined as the flux at which 
the average value of $\tsext$ for a source is 
e equal to 25 (for a given spectral model). This correseoncs
to an average extension significance of $5\sigma$.  This is not the
sensitivity to detect an extended source but instead the sensitivity to
resolve an already detected source as being extended.  

One would intuitivly expect that we would be less sensitivie to resolving
small extended sources since they would be lost in the PSF.  Similarly,
we would be less sensitive to very large extended sources which would
get completely lost in the background. Furtheremore, one expects our
sensitivity to be greater for harder sources since our angular resolution
improves significantly with energy.

To calculate the LAT's sensitivity to spatially extended sources,
we simulated sources with a uniform radially symmetric
disk morphology on top of a powerlaw Sreekumar-like isotropic
spectrum (\cite{sreekumar_isotropic}).  The Monte Carlo
simulation was perforormed over a one year time interval using a default
rocking profile and an assumed a represntative livetime fraction of 0.8.
For a given extension and spectral index, we calculated the
sensitivity by varying the flux of a source until we found 
when $\tsext=25$. In particular, we hand picked a flux range
where $\tsext<25$ and $\tsext>25$ and simulated 10 points with
a log uniform distribution in this range and performed an extension
test for each of these fluxes. Since the measured signifciance is
a statistical which will vary from realization to realization,
we then repeated this procedure $>15$ times for each spectral
and spatial model.  By fitting a line to the flux vs $\tsext$, we were
able to estimage the flux at which $\tsext=25$.

Our first result is the extension sensitivity for sources of varying
spectral indices. The result is shown in figure~\ref{index_sensitivity}.
We computed the sensitivty for sources with a spectral index of 1.5,
2, 2.5, and 3 and for sources of 20 extensions varying from $0.1\deg$
to $2.0\deg$. The $y$ axis is the 100 \mev to 100 \gev flux of the
source and the $x$ axis is the Monte Carlo extension. The curves then
represent the division in this extension and flux space where one gets
on average $\tsext=25$.
The solid lines of the plot are the sensitivity computed when using
with all photons with energry between 100 \mev and 100 \gev. The dashed lines is the
same sensitivity but only using photons with energy from 1 \gev to 100 \gev.

This results shows that our extension sensitivity is
significantly better for harder sources where there are more high
energy photons. Furthermore, our sensitivity is best for sources with an
extension around $0.5\deg$.  our sensitivity gets significantly worse
for very small sources and gets slightly worse for very large sources.

Futheremore, we note that except for the hardest or largest sources,
our sensitivity is almost entirly whether or not we use photons 
with energy from
100 \mev to 1 \gev. On the other hand, other systematic errors become
increasingly important at low energy so for our extension search we will
not use the photons in this energy range.

We performed a second computation to see how the LAT's extension
sensitivity varied with increasing background, as is at lower latitude
in the galactic plane. To do so, we computed the sensitivity using the
extragalactic barground as well as 10 and 100 times the extragalactic
background. The latter result approximatly represents the intensity of
the galactic diffuse emission near the galactic center. The results are
shown in figure~\ref{diff_factor_sensitivity}. Two plots are presented,
one fitting only in the energy range between 1 \gev and 100 \gev and
one fitting only in the energy range between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. For
each plot, the $y$ axis quotes the flux in the fit energy range and the
simulation was done only for a representivite spectral index 2 source.

These plots show that we are much less sensitivie to extended sources in
a higher background region. By comparing the two plots, we also see that
we would be more sensitive to an extended source if it had the same
integral flux, but only over a higher energy range. This is 
consistent with the improved angular resolution at higher energy.

\section{Extension search method}

The LAT two year catalog presented a search for all
statistically significant sources that are detected in the \gev
sky\cite{second_cat}.  The catalog group's source finding method assumes
that the emission originated as point sources and what was presented was
a list of all sources fit assuming a point source spatial hypothesis. 
Published extended sources were modeled by the catalog group as 
being extended, but no attempt was made to test if other sources in the catalog
could be spatially resolved.

We performed a search of all Fermi sources found in the second Fermi LAT
catalog for extension.  To perform this search, we built a model of the
sky consistent with the two year catalog's model.   We used the same two
years of data from August 4, 2008 to August 1, 2010 and we used the same
pass 7 instrument response function.  We used the same galactic diffuse,
isotropic diffuse, and earth limb emission model. The spectrum of the
galactic and isotropic diffuse models were refit during the analysis
while the earth limb emission was fixed to it's predicted value.

We performed the extension fit using \pointlike.  For each source, we
used a circular $10\deg$ region of interest centered on our source and
using 4 bins uniformly in each logarithm of energy.  We included all
background catalog sources within $15\deg$ of the source of interest
and refit the spectral parameters of sources within $2\deg$ of our source.

As was shown, we gain very little in sensitivity using photons with energy
below 1 \gev. On the other hand, the large PSF at low energy makes us
more succeptable to systmetic errors arising from source confusion due
to multiple point soruces and succeptable to incorrect modeling of the
galactic diffuse emission.  For that reason, we performed our search
using photons only between 1 \gev and 100 \gev.

We also performed a search for extended sources using photons only between
10 \gev and 100 \gev. Even though we are testing the same sources, this
approach is complimentary because there are regions in the galactic
plane where at lower energies the diffuse emission dominates and is
likely not perfectly modeled. On the other hand, at the highest energies
accessible by the LAT, the galactic diffuse emission will be smaller and
we might expect to detect significantly harder sources. This approach is
also beneficial because harder sources with nearby neighbors that are
softer may end up being incorrectly fit at lower energies but correctly
found looking only at the high energy.  This is also beneficial in the
galactic plane looking for possible extended sources near pulsars which
are very bright at lower energy but cutoff before 10 \gev.  This approach
of using only photons with energy above 10 \gev was succesfully used to detecting
HESS J1825-137 with the Fermi LAT~\cite{fermi_hess_j1825}.

For each catalog source, we modified the spectral index of the source
to be a powerlaw. We did this for two reasons. The first is that for a
source to be significantly extended, we would expect it to be reasonably
hard and therefore be fit reasonably well by a powerlaw.  The seond reason
is that since we begin our analysis at either 1 \gev or 10 \gev, we didn't
expect there to be significant curvature over this smaller energy range.
This method has the advantange that for the following analysis, we can
simply quote the fit powerlaw spectral index.

Finally, when analyzing our region, we automatically removed all other
catalog sources which were within 0.5\deg. This was done because of
a concern that truly extended sources might end up in the catalog as
multiple point sources. These spurious nearby catalogs sources might then
distort our fit enough that it no longer would show up as being extended.
Nevertheless, we investiated for each of our extended candidates if
if we seemed to be legitimatly removing real backgorund sources. And
we employed a dual localiation procedure (described above) to test
all of our candidates for source confusion.

For each catalog source, we modified the source to have a uniform radially
symmetric disk spatial shape and used \pointlike to simultaneously fit
the position and extension of the source.  We then selected all of the
sources for which \pointlike found $\tsext>16$.

\subsection{Additional Analysis}

We expect most extended sources to be inside teh galactic plane
since extragalactic sources are typically too far away to be
resolvable. Unfortunately, the \gev emission in the galactic plane
is dominated by anisotropic galactic diffuse emission.  Modeling the
galactic diffuse emission and finding sources on top of this emission is
difficult~\ref{first_diffuse_paper}. This issue has been discussed in the
Fermi catalog~\ref{first_cat,second_cat}. Furthermore, the galactic plane is
very crowded and so it is offent difficult to get a good model for the
region around a catalog source.  Because of this, finding a source with
$\tsext>16$ is not a sufficient test and we perform several crosschecks
to ensure our overal region is well modeled.


As an example of why this issue, we describe our test of P72Y3047 for
extension.  Figure~\ref{example_bad_fit} shows a smoothed counts map
using photons with energy above 1 \gev. In the map, the galacitc and isotropic diffuse
emission subtracted.  A two year catalog source P72Y3047 was found at the
position $(l,b)=(37.79\deg,1.14\deg)$.  By looking at the smoothed map,
we see that there appears to be overall some large scale residaul in the
diffuse emission along the galactic plane. Furthermore, it appears that
we don't have a great model of the nearby catalog sources. As a result,
P72Y3047 fits to a very large extension of 1.37\deg and the result is
statistically significant with \tsext=51.6.  By looking at the residuals,
it is clear that this complicated region is not well fit even though
the source's extension is statistically significant. For this reason,
we have to perform a series of followup analysis for all of the soruces
that are found with \tsext=16.
% information came from
% /nfs/slac/g/ki/ki03/lande/extended_catalog/2FGL/v15/standard_analysis/spectral_emin_1000_v1/P72Y3047/v1/results_followup_P72Y3047.yaml

First, we took the spatial and spectral model found using \pointlike
and performed a crosscheck by refitting the spectral parameters using
\gtlike.  We used a square ROI $14.1\deg$ in diamater with $1/16\deg$
pixels and the same energy binning. We found that $1/16\deg$ bins were
fine enough for \gtlike to get an extension significances consistent
with \pointlike.  Using \gtlike, we found a second measure of \tsext and
we only considered a source to be significanlty extended if \pointlike
and \gtlike both agreed.  For the new extended source candidates, with
table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} shows a comparison of their the value
of \tsext found by \gtlike and \pointlike.  Everywhere else, the values
from \gtlike are used.

Additionaly, we generated for each extended source candidate residual
test statistic (\ts) maps.  The residual \ts map is a map of the \ts
value evalualted at each point by adding onto the map at that position
a new source of spectral index 2 and finding the increase in lieklihood
when fitting its flux. \ts maps are especially useful as looking for
new sources or other residual featuers that are not included in the
model. They also have the advantagous feature that the aboslute scale
can be used to clearly look for when the residual is signifciant.
The downside is they are biased to look for residual features
that look like the PSF and so are not as sensitive to diffuse residual
features. Furthermore, since by defintion \ts>0, \ts maps can only show
positive fluctuations. Nevertheless, \ts maps were useful for
assessing the overal quality of the fit. Figure~\ref{res_tsmap}
shows an exmaple residual \ts map for the extended source IC443.


For each candidate, we also generated counts slices. A counts slice
plots the sum of all counts in the longitudinal direction within 2\deg in
the latitudinal direction.  The same plot is also shown integrating in
the longitudinal direction.  On top of the plot is overlayed the model
predicted counts assuming the source has a disk spatial model, assuming
the source is a point source, and fitting just the diffuse emission in
the region.  An example counts slice is shows for the extended source
IC443 in figure~\ref{counts_slice}. Counts slices were especially useful
for looking at how well the overal diffuse emisison model fits the region
near the sources.

For each candidate, we also made was a radial integral of the data. This
plot shows the sum of all counts within a given distance from the
source's center. The plot is binned uniformly in $\Delta \theta^2$ so
that an isotropic background will be flat in the plot. On top of this
plot is overlayed the model predicted counts assuming the source has a
disk spatial model, assumgng the source is a point source, and fitting
just the diffuse emisison in the region. An example radial integral
is shown for the extended source IC443 in figure~\ref{radial_profile}.
This plot is best for comparing the observed counts to the PSF.

Finally, for each source, we performed the dual localization method
described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method}.  We 
did so by replacing the source with two sources each containing
half of the original flux and then using \pointlike to
simulatnoulsy fit the postion and spectrum of these sources.
We then used \gtlike to refit the spectrum of these
sources using the best fit positions. For the
new extended sources found, we summarize the results of
this dual localization test and compare the values of \tsext
to \tsinc in table~\ref{dual_localization_results}.

for sources that seemed promising, we performed in a case
by case basis a refit of the region where we would move or delete
background catalog sources until it was clear that we had obtained on
a case by case a good overal fit of the region. This was necessary in
many situations whrere the position of background sources in the catalog
was not consistent and when the offet of the background sources biased
the fit extension of our source. This was likey the case because the
catalog positions of the backgorund sources came usign all photons above
100 \mev and the low energy localization disagreed with the higher energy
localization we found. This also happened in certain situations because
the localization of a backgorund source dependend upon correctly modeling
the extended source as being extended and so once we fit our source for
extension, we had to relcoalizae the backgorund source.  For each source,
we descirbe in a case by case basis any modifications which were required
to obtain a good fit of our source and the surrounding region.

\subsection{Alternate Diffuse Model Crosscheck}
\label{alt_diff_model_description}

To estimate systematic errors due to uncertaintly in our diffuse
emission background model, we performed an additional analysis
of our extended source candidates using an alternate diffuse
model. Our alterate model was based on the GALPROP\footnote{GALPROP
is a software package for calculating the dise Galactic $\gamma$-ray
emission based on a model of cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy. See
\url{http://galprop.stanford.edu/} for details and references} code
used in the Fermi LAT analysis of the isotropic diffuse emission
(\cite{isotropic_lat}).  In addition to using an alternate model, we
freeded additional compoents of this model and fit them simulatentously
with our source during the likelihood analysis. In particular,
we independently fit 7 HI rings, 7 HII rings, the inverse compoton,
and the E(B-V) residual component, and the isotropic and earth albedo
template. All told, there were 18 individual tempaltes where were all
simulatenously optimized during this analysis.

We do not expect that locally fitting tehse diffuse components would
produce a more physical model of the didffuse emission in the region.
But we do believe a source which does away when adding additional
degrees of freedom to the background model is likely spurious and so
this provides an important test of the valididity of our source.
The results of this fit for the new extended source candidates are
shown in table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results}. There is overal
good agreement between the \ts using the standard and alternate diffuse
models ($\ts_\gtlike$ and $\ts_\alt$ respectivly) and the \tsext values
(\tsextgtlike and \tsextalt respectivly).


\section{Validation of Known Extended Sources}
\label{validate_known}

We validated our method by testing for extension all of the sources
which the Fermi Collaboration had previously published on.  
This list includes the extended sources where were modeled
in the 2FGL catalog\cite{second_cat}.
This list contains the Large Magelenic Cloud and the Small Magilenic Cloud
which were first published in \cite{LMC,SMC}.
We also included the Supernova rememants IC443, W28, W30,
W44, W51C, and the Cygnus Loop which were 
first published in \cite{ic443,w28,w30,w44,w51c,cygnus_loop}.
We include the Pulsar Wind Nebulae Vela X, MSH 15-52, and 
HESS J1825-137\cite{velax,msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}.
In addition to those sources included by the catalog, we include in
this list the supernova rememnat RX J1713.7-3946 which was recently
published (\cite{RXJ1713}).

Since these sources are all included in the 2 year catalog, we applied
no special method to test these sources but used the same pipeline
that tested all other catalog sources for extension.  The results are
summarized in table~\ref{known_extended_sources}.  This table includes
the best fit position and extension. It also includes the source's
significance \ts and extension significance \tsext and the localization
error ellipse. The table also includes the best fit powerlaw spectral
model.

Using photons with energies greater than 1 \gev, our analysis succesfully
fit the extension of the LMC, SMC, IC443, W28, W30, W44, and W51C.
Using photons with energy above 10 \gev, we were able to succesffuly
fit the extesion of HESS J1825-137.
Our analysis of MSH 15-52 using photons with energy above 10 \gev found an extension
consistent with the publisehed result, but with $\tsext=11.2$. This is
most likely because the published analysis used a larger energy range,
considering all evnets above 6\gev. Looking at all photons with
energy above 1\gev 
is problematic because of background source confusion whereas using photons
with energy above 10\gev does not have the statistics for a significant dection.

Our analysis failed to detect the extension of Vela X. Vela X can only be
successfully analyzed after applying a phase cut to removed the heavily
dominant pular emission. It is beyond the scope of the paper to perform
such specialized analysis.

Our analysis also failed to detect a significant extension for the
Centaurus A Lobes.\cite{CenA paper}. This is most likely because the
discoverd emission was significantly more complicted then a uniform
radially symmetric Disk.  Furthermore, our analysis failed to correctly
fit the extension of the Cygnus Loop\cite{Cygnus Loop Paper}.  This is
most likely because Cygnus Loop is rather large and its shell type
morphology is not well represented by a uniform disk. The source is
also rather soft so the publisehd results used a larger energy range
then our search.

The difficulty our analysis analysis had fitting the extension of several
of the already published extended sources should be used to emphasize the
overal difficultly in studying spatially extendee sources with the Fermi
LAT, especially in the crowded galactic plane. For particular sources,
it is often necessary to perform careful and specalized analysis to
correctly find and model the sources we see. We can not claim our method
is complete.

\section{Test of 1LAC Sources}

To validate our method and assess systematic issues with our
analysis, we used \pointlike to test known active galaxies (AGN) for extension.
\gev emission from AGN is believed to comes from the
core of supermassive blackholes. Since this happens in a very small region
in the core of very distant galaxies,

AGN are not expected to be spatially resolvable and therefore
provide a good calibration source to demonstrate the efficacy of our
tool. Nevertheless, it would be very interesting if AGN could be
spatially resolved AGN and there are theories that predict
this\cite{pair_halo_paper}.

Following the Fermi-LAT one year catalog, the Fermi collaboration
published a list of the Fermi catalog sources that had a high probability
association with AGN. The first year catalog had 709 AGN associated with
671 distinct 1FGL sources at high latitude ($|b|>10\deg$).  For our
study, we are looking to assess systematics with extension fitting so
it is important to avoid any possible issues with AGN associations.
For that reason, we select only the 599 AGN which make it into the
``clean'' AGN sample. An AGN association is only considered ``clean''
if it has a high probability of association $P\ge 80\%$, if it is the
only AGN associated with the 1FGL source, and if there are no flags
on the source which shed doubt on the source\cite{first_cat}. These last two
conditions are especially important for our analysis. One might expect
source confusion between two AGN look like a spatially extended source.
Testing only unflagged sources is also important because it removes
any catalog sources coincident with structures in the diffuse emission.
It is possible that these flagged catalog sources which are really poorly
modeled diffuse emission might also look extended.

Of the 599 ``clean'' AGN, we select 556 of these 1FGL sources which
we uniquely associate with a 2 year catalog source. And we furthermore
restrict our select to 515 of these AGN for which we fit $\ts>25$ using
\pointlike.  Our intention here is not to find the largest sample of
AGN and this will be the scope of a follow up AGN association paper. Our
purpose is simply to find a good sample of AGN which can be used to
test the systematics of our tool.

Using the same extension fitting procedure as described above, we
test these 515 AGN for extension. A histogram of the \tsext values
computed with \pointlike
is shown in figure~\ref{agn_ts_ext}. Overlaid on the plot is again a
$\chi^2/2$ distribution suggested by Wilks' Theorem.  This plot shows
a worse agreement with the theoretical distribution then was found
by our Monte Carlo study in figure~\ref{ts_ext_mc}.  But overall, the
distribution is good. No AGN get fit with a particularly significant
value of $\tsext$. Almost all of the AGN get fit with $\tsext<1$ and
there are very few AGN fit with large values of \tsext.  There where
only 2 AGN having $\tsext>10$.  The maximum fit $\tsext=13.7$ whereas the
maximum value expected theoeritcally for the $\chi^2/2$ distribution is
8.3. This result therefore shows that there is some systematic on our
analysis but that we understand it and that it will not significantly
cast into doubt our subsequent results.
% 8.3 number gotten from mathematica:
% PDF[ChiSquareDistribution[1], x]
% N[Solve[(1/2)*
%     Integrate[1/(E^(x/2)*(Sqrt[2*Pi]*Sqrt[x])), {x, TS, Infinity}] &=&  
%        1/515, TS]]

Several possible systematics could cause this discrepancy. The first
is that in our analysis we fit each source with a powerlaw index.
AGN tend to have curved spectral and fitting with a wrong spectral
model might effect the value of \tsext. Nevertheless, since we use only
photons with energy above 1 \gev, this would effect is not expected to be large.
Another possible source for the discrepancy is that pointlike performs a
likelihood analysis without modeling the energy dispersion of our source.
But energy dispersion is expected to be more significant at low
energy and furthermore if this was a signifciant effect the same results
would have showed up with the Monte Carlo simultions which included the
effects of energy dispersion. 

Another possible systematic may be due to remaning issues with our
background model. Due to chance coincidence, a catalog source might
lie very close to nearby source. If the two sources were near enough,
they would be unresolvable by the catalog and the catalog would simply
fit them both together.  This could easily lead to an anomolously high
value of \tsext for a paritcular point source. Issues could also arise
from farther away but fainter sources which did not make the catalog's
significance cut, but nonetheless would pull the fitter away from the
point hyoptehsis.  Finally, it is possible that there are lingering
residuals in the diffuse emission in parts of the high latitude sky
which would cause the fitter to prefer a slightly extneded hypotehsis
that could fill in parts of the unmodeled diffuse emission.

The final possible effect causing this discrepancy is an imperfect
modeling of the PSF of the LAT.  Before launch, the LAT PSF
was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation of the detector.
After launch, a discrepancy was found using flight data above a
few \gev in the PSF measured using very bright AGN.  This result
was presented in conference and a publication is in preparation.
Subsequently, the PSF was fit empirically to these bright AGN and this
empirical parameterization is used in the Pass 7 Version 6 IRFs.\footnote{
LAT Collaboraiton publication pending.
%https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/download/attachments/102860834/FermiSymp2011_CAPSF_v5_ROTH.pptx
}. But our current parameterization is not perfect. There are especially
lingering issues due to lackign the statistics at high energy to
validate the PSF as a function of the incident $\theta$ angle of a
photon. Since the distribution of $\theta$ angles for observing any
sources is different, the PSF for every source should be different.
It is likely that these issues could cause this systematic in the fit
value of \tsext for AGN.

We should furtheremore note that since the PSF was found empirically in
the first place by fitting the shape of brigh AGN, finding that the AGN we
test are not significantly extended is not surprising.  We hope to note
that because of the difficulties in validating the PSF, we are strictly
searching for sources that are significantly extended when compared to
bright AGN measured by the LAT. Trying to look for the extension of these
AGN, or more realistically trying to put an upper limit on thier size,
would require its own dedicated analysis.

fit extension was $0.41\deg\pm0.05\deg$ and the best fit position is
$(l,b)=(353.09\deg, 16.79\deg)$ The source also appeared in the first
fermi catalog as 1FGL J1628.6-2419c.  and the extension significance
was $\tsext=28.9$.  A smoothed counts map showing this source is seen
in figure \ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c}.

This source is in a region of remarkably complicated diffuse emission.
Even though it is 16\deg from the Galactic plane,
the source is right on top of the core of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud,
which contains massive star-forming regions that are very bright
in the infrared.  The region has abundant molecular and atomic gas
traced by CO and HI but also plenty of dark gas, the kind that
we find only by its association with dust emission.\todo{Citation Needed}
Embedded star-forming regions make it even more challenging to measure
the column density of dust.\todo{Citation Needed}
\todo[inline]{Note about spectral index being typical of difuse emission}
Although this region is significantly extended, we conclude that what we
are seeing is most likely an inadequacy in the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission

The two year catalog source 2FGL J1551.3-5333 was found to be
extended using photons with energy between 1 \gev and 100 \gev.
We found an extension of $0.49\deg\pm 0.04\deg$ and an extension significance of
$\tsext=77.6$ at a position $(l,b)=(328.1387\deg,0.26\deg)$.  Figure
\ref{1FGL_J1554.0-5345c} shows a smoothed counts map of this source.

It was found in the one year catalog under the name 1FGL J1554.0-5345c.
To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL J1554.4-5317 which we believed to be suprious. By looking at
the counts map, we saw no differentation in the source at the location
of the two catalog sources. We tested this region for source confusion
by comparing the increase in log likelihood fitting the region as an
extended source (\tsext=77.6) to the increase in log likelihood fitting
the region as two point sources (\tsinc=48.6).  Since the extended
hypothesis is a has a higher likelihood, we conclude that the source is
spatially extended More
information about the dual localization results for this source are
shown in table \ref{dual_localization_results}.

There are no obvious counterparts to this source. Furthermore, this
source is relativly soft with a spectral index of $2.31$ and
very close to the galacitc plane in a region of large diffuse emission.
We conclude that although this region is significantly extended, it most
likely represents unmodeled diffuse emission.

The two year catalog source 2FGL J1615.2-5138 was found to be extended
using photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. We foudn an
extension of $0.52\deg$ with an extension significance of \tsext=75.3.
The source was fit to a position of $(l,b)=(331.74\deg,-0.58\deg)$.
Figure~\ref{1FGL_1613.6-5100c} shows a smoothed counts map of this source.

This source is coincident with the one year catalog source named 1FGL
J1613.6-5100c. To get a good fit for the region, we had to remove from our
model the nearby catalog sources 2FGL J1520.6-5111, 2FGL J1619.7-5040,
and 2FGL J1622.8-5006. Furthermore, to get a good fit of the region we
iterativly relocalized the source 2FGL J1615.0-5051 while fitting the
position and extension of 2FGL J1615.2-5138.  We ended up with a best
fit position of the nearby source 2FGL J1615.0-5051 having moved from
$(l,b)=(332.2684,0.043)$ to $(l,b)=(332.41,-0.29)$. This was necessary
because the initial localization of this source was done assumign that
2FGL J1615.2-5138 was modeled as several point sources.  To address
the possibility of source confusion, to compare the overal change in
likelihood fitting 2FGL J1615.2-5138 as two point sources and find
\tsinc=34.3 which is smaller then \tsext.

\section{Conclusion}

\todo[inline]{This conclusion needs to be written}

Many extended sources. Especially instructive to
use photons with energy above 10 \gev where we don't have
to worry about diffuse background as much.

Make some conclusion about how the LAT will eventually collect a factor
of five more data! Pointlike will be necessary to improve the model of the
high energy sky.

    This table presents a list of the spectral models (flux and spectral

    number of statistically indepdent simulations and the average test
    statistic found for that given spectral model ($\langle\ts\rangle$) is tabulated.
    The important feature to see in this table is that the Monte Carlo
    simulation probes most of the sources parameters that could be detected
    by the LAT.  The simulation probles a wide range of spectral indices
    (from spectral index $\gamma$ of 1.5 to 3) and a wide range of the fluxes
    (varying from a close to $5\sigma$ source detection to a $>10\sigma$
    source detection).  Only simluations which produced statistically
    significant detections ($\ts>25$) were kept.  What is quoted is the
    $>100$ \mev integral flux measured in units of $\ph/\cm^2/\s$.

      \caption{The fit results for the already known extended sources that
      were found by our analysis. The top results were found using an
      energy range between 1 \gev and 100 \gev.  The lower analysis
      was done using photons between 10 \gev and 100 \gev.  The quoted
      flux is in units of $10^{-9}\ph/\cm^2/\s$ and is the flux in the
      fit energy range (either 1 \gev to 100 \gev or 10 \gev to 100 \gev).
      All sources were fit using a uniform disk spatial template. The
      localization and extension were found using \pointlike while the
      TS and spectral values were calculated using \gtlike.  The TS value
      was computed using the assumed disk morphology and \tsext compares
      is the increase in \ts fitting the source with an extended spatial
      model instead of a point model.  \glon and \glat are respectivly
      the galactic longitute and galactic latitude of the source and
      $\sigma$ is the edge of the uniform disk spatial model that was fit
      to the source.  The Centaurus A Lobes, the Cygnus Loop, and Vela
      X were not found to be extended by this too. The
      reasons for this are discussed in section~\ref{validate_known}.

      \caption{For the new extended source candidates in
      figure~\ref{new_ext_srcs}, we describe the results
      of the dual localization procedure described in
      section~\ref{dual_localization_method}. Here, the extended
      source candidate is not fit as an extended source but instead
      fit as two point sources.  The dual localization is performed
      with \pointlike and results in the best fit position of the two
      sources $(\glon_1,\glat_1)$ and $(\glon_2,\glat_2)$.  The change in
      likelihood and spectral values are then computed using \gtlike with
      the best fit positions found by \pointlike.  \tsinc is the increase
      in TS fitting the region as two sources compared to fitting compared
      to fitting a single point source and is computed using \gtlike with
      the best fit positions taken from \pointlike.  It can be directly
      compared to \tsext, which is taken from table \ref{new_ext_srcs}.
      For all of our candiates, $\tsext > \tsinc$ which shows that an
      extended source fits the source better than two point sources.
      As in table~\ref{known_extended_sources}, flux is measured in
      units of $10^{-9}\ph/\cm^2/\s$ and is the integral flux between
      1 \gev (10 \gev) and 100 \gev for the sources found using photonons above 1 \gev (10 \gev).

      This table shows a comparison of the \ts values gotten using \gtlike and \pointlike.
      It also compares the fit values using the standard diffuse model and using the alternate
      diffuse model described in section~\ref{alt_diff_model_description}.
      $\ts_\pointlike$ is the \ts of the source fit with the extended hypothesis using \pointlike
      whereas $\ts_\gtlike$ is the same quantity using the same model but fitting with \gtlike.
      There is very good agreement between the two methods.
