\begin{abstract}
We present a new method for analyzing 
the spatial extension of sources with
the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the
{\em Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope} (FGST). 
Spatial extension
is an important input to correctly 
associate LAT sources with their counterparts at other
wavelengths. We perform
a series of Monte Carlo studies to validate this tool and calculate
the LAT's detection threshold to detect the extension of 
spatially extended sources.  We then
apply this tool to test all sources in the two year source catalog for
extension. We report the detection of nine spatially extended sources
in addition to the twelve spatially extended sources reported in the
second Fermi-LAT Catalog (2FGL).

\section{Introduction}

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair conversion telescope on the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (FGST) that been surveying the $\gamma$-ray
sky since June 2008.  The LAT has a broad energy coverage (20 \mev to $>300$
\gev), wide field of view ($\approx 2.4 \sr$), and large effective area
($\approx 8000 \cm^2$ at $>1 \gev$).

Using two years of all-sky surveying data, the LAT Collaboration published
a catalog of 1873 \gev sources \citep{second_cat}. Many of these can be
positionally associated with a variety of source classes including Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN), pulsars, galaxies, and supernova remnants (SNRs).
While the counterparts of many LAT sources
can be spatially resolved when observed
at other frequencies, detection of an extension at \gev energies by
the LAT is complicated by the large point-spread function (PSF)
of the instrument. The angular resolution for events converting in the
thin conversion foils of the tracker system, defined as the 68\% containment radius for
a point source, is approximately $3.5^{\circ}$ at 100 \mev, improving
to about 0.1$^{\circ}$ at 10 \gev.

However, a number of sources positionally coincident with LAT sources
exhibit extensions at other wavelengths which are comparable to or larger than 
the LAT PSF.  In particular, certain SNRs, pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe),
molecular clouds, normal galaxies, galaxy clusters or dark matter
satellites can therefore be expected to be detected as spatially extended
sources by the LAT.  
The LAT collaboration has previously reported five SNRs which are
spatially extended beyond the LAT PSF at \gev energies 
(IC443, W28, W44,
W51C, and RX J1713.7-3946 \citep{ic443,w28,w44,w51c,rx_j1713_lat}). In
addition, three extended PWNe were detected: MSH 15-52, Vela~X,
and HESS\,J1825-137 \citep{msh1552,velax,fermi_hess_j1825}, as well
as two close-by galaxies, the Large Magellanic and Small Magalenic
Cloud \citep{lmc,smc}, and finally the radio galaxy Centarus A
\citep{cen_a_lat}.

For each of these sources, the extension was determined based on
dedicated analysis of the particular source 
instead of being the outcome of a systematic search of the LAT catalog.
For the systematic scan of all LAT catalog sources presented in this work, we
therefore expect to find additional spatially extended LAT sources, in
particular since many extended sources in the Galactic plane have been
detected at \tev energies using air Cherenkov detectors and \tev and
\gev emission often originates from the same population of high-energy
particles.  A variety of spatially extended sources have been detected
in the Galactic plane at \tev energies. Most prominent was a survey of
the Galactic plane using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S)
which reported 14 spatially extended sources
 with extensions varying from
$~0.1\deg$ to $~0.25\deg$ \citep{hess_plane_survey}.
In fact, within
our Galaxy only very few sources (most notably the $\gamma$-ray binaries
LS\,5039 \citep{HESSLS5039}, LS I+61-303 \citep{MAGICLSI, VERITASLSI}
HESS\,J0632+057 \citep{HESS0632}, and the Crab nebula \citep{crab_weekes}
have 
no significant extension detected at \tev energies. Given
these findings, it can be expected that if the source population at \gev
energies has similar properties, that at least some of the Fermi-LAT
sources in our Galaxy should be spatially resolvable at \gev energies.

\begin{shaded} 
High energy $\gamma$-rays are produced by the decay of $\pi^0$s produced
by hadronic interactions with interstellar matter and by relativistic
electrons due to Inverse Compton (IC) scattering and Bremsstrahlung
radiation.  Many of these spatially extended \tev sources in the
Galactic plane are unidentified. Some of these sources could produce
hadronic cosmic rays up to $\approx 10^{15}$ eV and subsequently radiate
$\gamma$-rays through $\pi^0$ decay \citep{blandford_and_eichler_1987}.
Studying the spectra of these \tev sources at \gev energies may help to
determine the emission mechanisms of these high energy sources.
\end{shaded} 

The capability to
spatially resolve GeV $\gamma$-ray sources is
important for several reasons. 
First, multiple potential counterparts detected at other frequencies
exist within the localization confidence region of a typical LAT source
along the Galactic plane.
Finding a coherent
source extension across different energy bands allows a firm association
of a LAT source to an otherwise confused counterpart.  Also, due
to the strong energy dependence of the LAT PSF,
the spatial and spectral information
about a source do not simply decouple. An inaccurate spatial model will bias
the spectral model of the source. Specifically, performing a spectral
analysis on a spatially extended source modeled as point-like will
systematically shift the spectral index to be softer.  Furthermore,
correctly modeling a source's extension is important for improving
the model of the sky and removing excess residuals, for example in the
region around surrounding the Large Magellanic Cloud \citep{first_cat}.
Additionally, such excess residuals potentially bias the significance
and measured spectrum of neighboring sources in the densely populated
Galactic plane.

\section{Analysis Methods}

Morphological studies of sources in the \gev energy range using the
LAT are challenging because of the strongly energy-dependent PSF.
Additional complications arise for sources along the Galactic plane due to
systematic uncertainties in the Galactic diffuse emission.  The LAT's
PSF is limited at its lowest detectable energies by multiple scattering in the tracker
and the 68\% containment radius of the PSF is approximately 5.1\deg
at 100 \mev  when averaged over instrument acceptance and including
photons which convert in either the thick or thin layers of the
tracker. The PSF improves with energy and approaches a limit given
by the granularity of the silicon strips and is 0.14\deg at 10 \gev
\citep{on_orbit_calibration}.  However, since most high energy
astrophysical sources have power-law spectra, the better resolution of the higher
energy photons is offset by their low
statistics. Therefore a detailed investigation has been performed in this
work to determine the optimal energy range to measure source extension
(section \ref{extended_source_search_method}).

\subsection{The \pointlike Package}

A new analysis tool has been developed to address the unique requirements
for studying spatially extended sources with the LAT. The tool
performs a maximum likelihood analysis in which the Poisson likelihood
for observing the measured counts is maximized,
given a parametrized spatial and spectral model of 
the source and its surrounding region.
The extension of a source can be modeled by a
geometric shape (e.g. a disk or Gaussian) and the source's position,
extension, and spectrum can be simultaneously fit.

This analysis is not feasible using the standard LAT likelihood
analysis tool \gtlike\footnote{\gtlike is distributed publicly by the
Fermi Science Support Center \citep{fssc}} because \gtlike can only 
fit the spectral parameters of the model unless a more sophisticated
iterative procedure is used to also test various source morphologies.
We note that \gtlike has been used in the past in several studies of
source extension in the LAT collaboration \citep{lmc,smc,w28,w51c}.
Based upon a set of \gtlike maximum likelihood fits at fixed extensions,
a profile of the likelihood as a function of the extension was calculated.
This approach is not optimal because the position, extension, and
spectrum of the source must be simultaneously fit to find the best fit
parameters and to correctly compute the statistical significance of the
detection.  Furthermore since the \gtlike likelihood profile approach
is computationally intensive, no large-scale Monte Carlo effort has been
run to validate it.

The approach presented here is based on a second maximum likelihood
fitting package developed in the LAT collaboration called \pointlike
\citep{first_cat,matthew_kerr_thesis}.  We extended the code to allow
a simultaneous fit of the source extension together with the position
and the spectral parameters.

The choice to base the spatial extension fitting on \pointlike
rather than \gtlike was made on considerations of computing time.
The \pointlike algorithm was optimized for speed to handle
larger numbers of sources efficiently which is important for
our catalog scan as well as the Monte Carlo validation of our method.
Details on the \pointlike package can be found in \cite{matthew_kerr_thesis}.

\subsection{Extension Fitting}
\label{extension_fitting}

In \pointlike, it is assumed that the spatial and spectral
model of an extended source are separable, i.e. that the source
model $M(l,b,E)=S(l,b)\times X(E)$ where $S(l,b)$ is the spatial
distribution and $X(E)$ is the spectral distribution.  To fit an extended source,
\pointlike convolves the extended source shape with the PSF (as a
function of energy) and uses the \minuit library to maximize the
likelihood by simultaneously varying the position and extension of
the source \citep{minuit_documentation}.  As will be described in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}, simultaneously fitting the position
and extension is important to correctly calculate the statistical
significance of the detection of extension.  For each position and
extension, the spectral parameters of the sky model are refit.  To avoid
projection effects, the fitted source position parameters are not the
source's longitude and latitude but instead the source's displacement
in a rotated reference frame.

The significance of the extension of a source can be calculated
from \tsext, which 
is the test statistic of the likelihood ratio test of
a model with a spatially extended source and a model
with a point-like source and is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \tsext=2\log(\likelihood_\text{ext}/\likelihood_\text{ps}) = 2 (\loglikelihood_\text{ext}-\loglikelihood_\text{ps})
\end{equation}
where \loglikelihood is the log of the Poisson likelihood.
\pointlike calculates \tsext by fitting a source first with a spatially
extended model and then as a point source.  The interpretation
of \tsext in terms of a statistical significance is discussed in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}.

For extended sources with an assumed radially symmetric shape,
we use a semi-analytic calculation to speed up the calculation of
the expected photon distribution. The expected photon 
distribution can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(\vec r) = \int  \text{PSF}(|\vec r - \vec r'|)I_\text{src}(\vec r') r'^2 dr' d\phi'
\end{equation}
For the LAT, the PSF can be parameterized by a {\em King function}
\begin{equation}
  \text{PSF}(r) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}
  \left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left(1+\frac{u}{\gamma}\right)^{-\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $u=(r/\sigma)^2/2$ and $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ are free parameters
\citep{matthew_kerr_thesis}.  For radially symmetric extended sources,
the angular part of the integral can be evaluated analytically
\begin{align}
  \text{PDF}(u) & = \int_0^\infty r'^2 dr'
  I_\text{src}(v) 
  \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi' 
  \text{PSF}(\sqrt{2\sigma^2(u+v-2\sqrt{uv}\cos(\phi-\phi'))})
  \\
  & = \int_0^\infty dv
  I_\text{src}(v) 
  \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma + u + v}\right)^\gamma 
  \times {}_2F_1 \left(\gamma/2,\frac{1+\gamma}{2},1,\frac{4uv}{(\gamma+u+v)^2}\right).
\end{align}
where $v=(r'/\sigma)^2/2$ and ${}_2F_1$ is the Gaussian hypergeometric
function.  This convolution formula reduces the expected photon
distribution to a single numerical integral.

There will always be a small numerical discrepancy between the expected
photon distribution derived from a true point source and a very small
extended source due to numerical error in the convolution.  In most
situations, this error is insignificant.  But in particular for
very bright sources, this numerical error has the potential to bias the
test statistic for the extension test. Therefore, when calculating
\tsext, we compare the likelihood fitting the source with an extended
spatial model to the likelihood when fixing its extension to ${10^{-10}}\deg$.

We estimate the error on the extension of a source by fixing the position
of the source and varying the extension until the likelihood has fallen
by $\tfrac{1}{2}$, corresponding to a $1\sigma$ error.  This method is
shown schematically in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(a) which shows the
change in \loglikelihood when varying the extension of the SNR IC443.
The localization error is calculated by fixing the extension and spectrum
of the source and fitting to the likelihood function a Gaussian as a function
of position.

\subsection{\gtlike Analysis Validation}
\label{gtlike_crosscheck}

\pointlike is important for LAT analyses that require many iterations
such as source localization and extension fitting.  On the other hand,
because of the fewer approximations used in calculating the likelihood
we expect the spectral parameters found with \gtlike to be slightly
more precise.  Furthermore, because \gtlike is the standard likelihood
analysis package, it has been more extensively validated for spectral
analysis.  For those reasons, in the following analysis  we use \pointlike
to determinate the position and extension of a source and subsequently determine
the spectrum using \gtlike. Both \gtlike and \pointlike can be 
used to estimate
the statistical significance of the extension of a source and we require
that both methods agree to claim a detection.

We found good agreement between the two methods.  
Unless explicitly mentioned, all \ts, \tsext, and spectral
parameters were calculated using \gtlike using the best-fit
positions and extensiosn found with \pointlike.

\subsection{Dual Localization}
\label{dual_localization_method}

There is a degeneracy between a spatially extended source and multiple
point sources that are separated by angular distances comparable or
smaller than the size of the LAT PSF.  To assess the possibility of source
confusion, we developed a function in \pointlike to simultaneously fit
the position of two point sources.

We define \tsinc as twice the increase in \loglikelihood fitting the
region as two point sources compared to fitting the region as one point
source: 
\begin{equation}
  \tsinc=2\times(\loglikelihood_\text{2pts}-\loglikelihood_\text{ps}).
\end{equation} 
\tsinc can not be directly compared to \tsext to see which
model is more significant because the models are not nested
\citep{statistics_with_care}. Even though the comparison of \tsext with
\tsinc is not a calibrated test, we find the cases $\tsinc \ll \tsext$
or $\tsinc\gg\tsext$ suggestive and we only consider a source to be
extended if $\tsext>\tsinc$.
Similar to the case of extended sources described in section~\ref{gtlike_crosscheck},
the spectrum of the two point sources can be refit using \gtlike.
We quote the spectral values obtained from \gtlike using the best fit
positions found using \pointlike.  

\subsection{Comparing Source Sizes}

\label{compare_source_size}

We tested two different models for the
surface brightness profile, either a two dimensional Gaussian
\begin{equation}\label{gauss_pdf}
  I(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}\exp\left(-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma^2\right)
\end{equation}
or a uniform disk
\begin{equation}\label{disk_pdf}
  I(x,y)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\pi\sigma^2} & x^2+y^2\le\sigma^2 \\
    0                      & x^2+y^2>\sigma^2
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Although these shapes are significantly different, their convolution
with the PSF look similar.  Figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss}
demonstrates this by showing $I_\text{src}$, the PSF, and the PDF for
a radially symmetric uniform brightness and the Gaussian surface brightness of size 0.5\deg.\footnote{To
allow a valid comparison between Gaussian and disk shaped morphologies,
we define the source size for this test as the radius containing
68\% of the intensity ($\rsixeight$).  $\rsixeight_\text{,Gaussian}=1.51\sigma$
and $\rsixeight_\text{,disk}=0.82\sigma$ where $\sigma$
is defined in equation~\ref{gauss_pdf} and
equation~\ref{disk_pdf} respectively.} This plot shows that the LAT is 
not very sensitive to probing the exact structure of an extended source.
In the search for extended sources, we therefore use only a uniform
disk as our spatial extension shape. We then quote the radius of the
disk edge as the size of the source.

\section{Validation of Analysis Method}

\label{monte_carlo_validation}

We test the performance of \pointlike fitting the extension of
point-like sources.
\cite{mattox_egret} discuss that the test statistic distribution
for a likelihood ratio test on the existence of a source at
a given position is 
\begin{equation}\label{ts_ext_distribution}
  P(\ts)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\chi^2_1(\ts)+\delta(\ts)).
\end{equation}
The particular form of equation \ref{ts_ext_distribution} is
due to the null hypothesis (source flux $\Phi=0$) residing
on the edge of parameter space and the model hypothesis
adding a single degree of freedom. It is plausible to
expect a similar distribution of the test statistic
in the test for source extension as the same conditions
apply (with the source flux $\Phi$ replaced by the source radius $r$ and
$r<0$ being unphysical).
To validate this claim, we performed a Monte Carlo
study to calculate empirical distributions for $\tsext$ and
compared them to equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution}.

We simulated point sources with various spectral forms using
\gtobssim\footnote{\gtobssim is distributed by the Fermi Science Support
Center \citep{fssc}.} and fit them with \pointlike using both point
and extended source hypotheses.  The point sources were simulated with a power-law
spectral model with integrated fluxes above 100 \mev ranging from $3\times
10^{-9}$ to $10^{-6}$ \phflux in six discrete steps and spectral
indices ranging from 1.5 to 3 in four discrete steps.  These values
were picked to to represent typical source parameter of LAT-detected
sources. The point sources were simulated on top of an isotropic
background with an integrated flux above 100 \mev of $1.5\times10^{-5}$
taken to be the same as the isotropic spectrum measured by EGRET
\citep{sreekumar_isotropic}.  The Monte Carlo simulation was performed
over a one year observation period using a default rocking profile and a
representative livetime fraction of 0.8.  The reconstruction was performed
using 1-100 \gev photons and the Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6) Source Instrument
Response Function (IRFs, \cite{lat_on_orbit_psf}).  For each 
significantly detected point source ($\ts>25$), we used \pointlike
to fit it as an extended source and calculate \tsext.


For each set of spectral parameters, $\approx30,000$ statistically independent
simulations were performed. For the dimmer spectral models, many of the
simulations left the source undetected ($\ts<25$)
and were discarded.  Table~\ref{ts_ext_num_sims}
shows the different spectral models used in our study as well as the
number of simulations.  The cumulative density of \tsext is plotted in
figure~\ref{ts_ext_mc}. The $\chi^2_1/2$ distribution of
equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution} is overlaid for comparison.

Our Monte Carlo study shows broad agreement between simulations and
equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution}. Nevertheless, the agreement is not
perfect.  It should be noted that the discrepancy seems to be worst for
bright sources, a likely cause being numerical errors in the convolution
becoming more apparent for sufficiently bright sources.  Other possible
reasons for departure from equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution} could
be that \pointlike ignores energy dispersion which would change the
PSF shape as a function of energy. We emphasize that many of
the empirical distributions lies to the left of the theoretical curve so
using the theoretical distribution would lead to an underestimate of the
statistical significance of a detection. Therefore, we are confident that
$\sqrt{\tsext}$ can be used as a conservative measure of the statistical
significance of a source's extension and use it in the following analysis.

\section{Extended Source Detection Threshold}
\label{extension_sensitivity}

We calculated the LAT's detection threshold to resolve spatially extended
sources as being extended. We define the detection threshold as the flux at which the value
of $\tsext$ averaged over many statistical realizations of a source
is $\langle\tsext\rangle=16$, corresponding to a $4\sigma$ detection
(see section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}).

We used the simulation setup described in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}, but instead simulated extended
sources with a radially symmetric uniform surface
brightness and
simulated over the actual two year time interval of LAT observations.  
For each extension and
spectral index, we selected a flux range which bracketed $\tsext=16$
and performed an extension test for $>100$ independent realizations of
ten flux values in this range.
We calculated $\langle\tsext\rangle=16$ by fitting a line to the flux
and $\tsext$ values in this narrow range.

Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows the threshold for sources of four
spectral indices from 1.5 to 3 and extension varying from $\sigma=0.1\deg$
to $2.0\deg$.  The LAT's flux threshold for a significant detection
of source extension drops quickly with
increasing source size and reaches a minimum around 0.5\deg. 
Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows
the threshold using photons with energies between 100 \mev and 100 \gev
and also using only 1-100\gev photons.
Except for very large ($>1\deg$) sources, our detection threshold is
not substantially improved including photons with energies between 100 \mev and
1 \gev.  This is also demonstrated in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(b)
which shows \tsext for the SNR IC443 computed independently in twelve
energy bins between 100 \mev and 100 \gev. For IC443, which has a
spectral index $\approx2.4$, almost the entire increase in \ts comes
from energies above 1 \gev.  On the other hand, other systematic errors
become increasingly important at low energy. For our extension search,
we therefore use only photons with energies above 1 \gev.

\begin{shaded} Figure~\ref{all_sensitivity} shows the flux threshold
as a function of source extension for different background levels (1x,
10x, and 100x the nominal background), different spectral indices, and
two different energy bands (1-100 \gev and 10-100 \gev).  The detection
threshold is higher for sources in regions of higher background.  For a
fixed 1-100 \gev or 10-100 \gev flux, the LAT's detection threshold
is only weakly depends upon the spectral index.  This effect is most
pronounced when using only photons with energies above 10 \gev.  Overlaid
on figure~\ref{all_sensitivity} are the LAT detected extended sources
that will be discussed in sections~\ref{validate_known}
and \ref{new_ext_srcs_section}.  The extension thresholds are tabulated
in table~\ref{all_sensitivity_table}.

Finally, figure~\ref{time_sensitivity} shows the LAT's projected detection
threshold to extension after 10 years against 10 times the isotropic
background. This background is representative of the background near
the Galactic plane.  For small extended sources, our detection threshold
improves by a factor larger than the square root of time because at high energies, where we
are most sensitive to extension, the background levels are in the Poisson
instead of Gaussian regime.  For large extended sources, the relevant
background is larger and the improvement is closer to the expected
factor of the square root of time.
\end{shaded}


\section{Extended Source Search Method}
\label{extended_source_search_method}

We test all sources in the 
second Fermi-LAT Catalog (2FGL) for spatial extendedness.
2FGL is a catalog of 1873 sources detected by the LAT.  It included
twelve previously published spatially extended sources but did not
attempt to fit the extension of these sources. Other than these sources,
all 2FGL sources were modeled as point sources and 2FGL did not attempt
to resolve the extension of new sources.

Our analysis setup is closely related to the setup used for the
derivation of the catalog We used the same two years of data from August
4, 2008 to August 1, 2010 and we used the same Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6)
Source class event selection and IRFs \citep{lat_on_orbit_psf}.  We used the same models to describe the
background from Galactic diffuse, isotropic, and earth limb emission.
The galactic diffuse emission was scaled by a power-law and the isotropic
component's normalization was left free.

As was shown in section~\ref{extension_sensitivity}, we gain little in sensitivity using photons with energies
below 1 \gev. On the other hand, the large PSF at low energy makes us
more susceptible to systematic errors arising from source confusion due
to multiple point sources and susceptible to incorrect modeling of the
Galactic diffuse emission. In addition, the Galactic diffuse emission
is more pronounced at lower energies due to its steep energy spectrum.
For that reason, we performed our search using photons only between 1
\gev and 100 \gev. 

We also performed a search for extended sources using only 10-100 \gev photons. 
Even though we are testing the same
sources, this approach is complimentary because the Galactic diffuse
emission is even less dominant above 10 \gev. Furthermore, source
confusion becomes less of a problem since most LAT sources are not
significantly detected at energies exclusively above 10 \gev. So we
expect to be able to resolve harder sources in more complicated regions. The $>10$ \gev
analysis is
especially
beneficial for regions near pulsars which are not significantly above 10 \gev and was
successfully used in detecting HESS\,J1825-137 and MSH 15-52 with the LAT
\citep{msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}.

We tested each source for extension using
\pointlike
assuming the source had a uniform radially symmetric surface brightness
and a power-law spectral model.
We used a circular $10\deg$ region of interest centered on our source and
included all catalog sources within $15\deg$ of the source of interest
in our background model.
We refit the spectral parameters of sources within $2\deg$ of the source
to avoid potential biases of the extension parameters of the source of
interest due to close-by background sources.

Finally, when analyzing the region, we automatically removed other 2FGL
sources which were within 0.5\deg of the source of interest. This was
done to avoid a concern that extended sources are included in 2FGL as
multiple point sources. These spurious sources could distort the
extension fit.  Instead, when a source is found to be significantly
extended (i.e. $\tsext>16$), we perform the dual localization procedure
(described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method} to compare the
extended source hypothesis to the hypothesis of two independent point
sources. Only sources with $\tsext>\tsinc$ are considered as extended.

\subsection{Additional Analysis}

Based on size vs. physical distance considerations,
we expect most extended sources to be located inside our Galaxy
adn thus to be concentrated along the Galactic plane.  Unfortunately, the \gev emission
in the Galactic plane is dominated by extremely structured 
diffuse emission from the interactions of cosmic rays with the
interstellar medium.  Finding sources on top of this emission is difficult
\citep{first_diffuse_paper} as has been discussed in 1FGL and 2FGL
\citep{first_cat,second_cat}.  Furthermore, the Galactic plane is crowded
and it is often difficult to correctly model nearby sources.  Because of this,
finding a source with $\tsext>16$ is not a sufficient
criteria for resolving a source. For each extended source,
we perform several analysis crosschecks.

For each candidate, we generated a map of residual \ts by adding a new
source of spectral index 2 into the region and finding the increase in
likelihood when fitting its flux. \ts maps are useful to look for residual
structure in the sky model.  Figure~\ref{res_tsmaps} shows a residual \ts
map for the extended source IC443.  The residual \ts map indicates that
the spatially extended model for IC443 is a significantly better description
of the observed photons.
We also generated plots of the sum of
all counts within a given distance of the source and compared it to the
model predictions of a point source.  
An example radial integral plot is shown for the extended source IC443
in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(c).  For each source, we also made
diffuse-emission-subtracted smoothed counts
maps. Figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(d) shows an example for IC443.

% 2FGL J1856.2+0450c = P72Y3047 for
We then inspected the residual \ts, smoothed counts maps, and radial
integral distributions to identify cases in which the extension fit
is clearly influenced by large-scale residuals in the diffuse emission
and hence the extension measurement unreliable.  An example of such a
case is shown in figure~\ref{example_bad_fit}. It shows a Galactic and
isotropic diffuse-emission-subtracted smoothed counts map of this source
using 1-100 \gev photons.  In this region along the Galactic plane,
there appears to be large-scale residual in the diffuse emission. As
a result, 2FGL\,J1856.2+0450c fit to an extension of 1.83\deg and the
result is statistically significant with \tsext=45.4. However, by looking at
the residuals it is clear that this complicated region is not fit well
even though the source's extension is statistically significant. We do
not report sources as extended that fail this inspection.

For the remaining candidates, 
we took the spatial and spectral model found using \pointlike and
re-determined the spectral 
parameters using
\gtlike.  We used 
the `binned likelihood' mode of \gtlike on a $14\deg\times14\deg$
ROI with a pixel size of 0.03\deg.
We obtained a second measure of \tsext from \gtlike for the extension
and position of the source as determined by \pointlike.
We only considered a source to be significantly extended if $\tsext>16$ with
both \pointlike and \gtlike.  

Because of the high source density in the Galactic plane, for promising
candidates we often had to iteratively improve the model of our background
sources to obtain a better fit of the sources.  Several catalog
sources would often fill in the emission of the extended source and would
have to be removed from the region.  Similarly, background sources
were often insignificant in the fit energy range and had to be removed.
The position of background sources would often have to be refit once the
extended source was fit.  When the model of the extended source coupled
strongly with nearby sources, we iteratively fit the extended source and
all nearby sources until the fit converged.  For each extended source,
we describe the modifications of the background model compared to the model
used in the creation of the 2FGL catalog that were required.

\subsection{Systematic Errors on Extension}
\label{systematic_errors_on_extension}

% Alternative PSF

We estimate a systematic error on the extension of a source due to
uncertainty in our knowledge of the LAT PSF.  Before
launch, the LAT PSF was determined by a detector simulation which was
verified in accelerator tests \citep{atwood_LAT_mission}. However,
in-flight data revealed a discrepancy
above a few \gev in the PSF compared to the
photon angular distribution of bright AGN.  A publication on this issue is in preparation
\citep{lat_on_orbit_psf}.  Subsequently, the PSF was fit empirically to
bright AGN and this empirical parameterization is the default PSF used
in the P7\_V6 IRFs.  To account for this uncertainty in our knowledge of
the PSF, we refit our extended source candidates using the Monte Carlo
representation of the PSF and consider the difference in extension found
using the two PSFs as a systematic error on the extension of a source.
The same approach was used in
\citep{ic443}.  At high energies, we believe that our parameterization
of the PSF from bright AGN is substantially better than the Monte Carlo
representation of the PSF so this estimate of systematic errors is conservative.

% Alternate Diffuse

We estimate a second systematic error on the extension of a source
due to uncertainty in the model of the Galactic diffuse emission by
using an alternative diffuse model. An alternative model was based upon
GALPROP\footnote{GALPROP is a software package for calculating the
Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission based on a model of cosmic-ray propagation
in the Galaxy. See \url{http://galprop.stanford.edu/} for details and
references} and used in the LAT analysis of the isotropic diffuse
emission \citep{isotropic_lat}.  
The intensities of various components to the galactic
diffuse emission are then fitted individually using a spatial
distribution of the intensities within the ROI 
as predicted by the model.
We distinguish contributions from CR interactions with
the molecular hydrogen, the atomic+ionized hydrogen,
residual gas traced by dust \citep{isabelle_dark_gass},
and the interstellar radiation field. We further
split the contributions from interactions with molecular
and atomic hydrogen to the
Galactic diffuse emission according
to the distance from the Galactic center in
which they are produced. Hence, we replace
the standard diffuse emission model by 18
individually fitted templates to describe individual
components of the diffuse emission.
A similar crosscheck was used in the
LAT Collaboration's analysis of RX J1713.7-3946 \citep{rx_j1713_lat}.

It is not expected that this diffuse model is superior to the standard
LAT model that was obtained through an all-sky fit.  But adding degrees of freedom to the background model can
remove likely spurious sources that correlate with features in the
Galactic diffuse emission.  Therefore, this tests systematics that may
be due to incorrect modeling of the diffuse emission in the region.

We do not except the systematic error due to uncertainties in the PSF to
be correlated to the systematic due to uncertainty in the Galactic diffuse
emission so the total systematic error on the extension of a source so
we obtain the total systematic error by adding them in quadrature.

\section{Analysis of Extended Sources Identified in 2FGL}
\label{validate_known}

% 6 SNRs 

We first present on our analysis of the twelve extended sources
included in 2FGL.
\citep{second_cat}.
The six extended SNRs IC443, W28, W30, W44, W51C, and the
Cygnus Loop were included in 2FGL.  IC443, W28, W44, W51C, and the
Cygnus Loop were
first reported in \cite{ic443,w28,w44,w51c,cygnus_loop_lat}.  A
detailed publication by the LAT
collaboration about W30 is still in preparation.
\gev emission from W30 was also studied in \cite{castro_and_slane_2010}.
Using 1-100 \gev photons, our analysis significantly detected the
extension of all six SNRs.
% 2 galaxies

Two nearby satellite galaxies of the Milky Way the Large Magalenic Cloud (LMC)
and the Small Magalenic
Cloud (SMC) were included in 2FGL as spatially extended sources \citep{lmc,smc}.  They were significantly
detected using 1-100 \gev photons. Our
fit extension is comparable to the published result, but we note that
previous LAT collaboration publication on LMC used a more complicated two Gaussian surface
brightness spatial model when fitting it (\citep{lmc}).

% 3 PWN
Three PWNe Vela X, MSH 15-52, and HESS\,J1825-137 were
already identified in 2FGL \citep{velax,msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}.  
HESS\,J1825-137 was significantly detected using 10-100 \gev photons.
To improve the model of this source, we removed the
nearby catalog source 2FGL\,J1823.1-1338c which is part of the extended
source.  To avoid confusion with the nearby bright pulsar PSR J1509-5850, MSH 15-52 must be
analyzed at high energies.  Using photons with energies above 10 \gev,
we fit the extension of MSH 15-52 to be consistent with the published
size with an extension significance of \tsext=6.5.  

% failed to detect vela x + cen a
Our analysis was unable to resolve Vela X which would have required first
removing the pulsed photons from the Vela pulsar which is beyond the
scope of this paper.  Our analysis also failed to detect a significant
extension for the Centaurus A Lobes \citep{cen_a_lat}. This is because
the source's emission is significantly different from a uniform
radially symmetric surface brightness.

Our analysis of these sources is summarized in
table~\ref{known_extended_sources}.  This table includes the best fit
position and extension of these sources when fitting them as disk-shaped
sources with a radially symmetric uniform surface brightness. It also
includes the best fit spectral parameters for each source.  The position
and extension of Vela X and the Centaurus A Lobes are included in this
list for completeness.

\section{Test of 2LAC Sources}
\label{test_2lac_sources}

To validate our method, we test LAT sources associated with AGN for
extension.  \gev emission from AGN is believed to originate from the cores
of kpc-scale jets of distant galaxies.  Therefore AGN are not expected
to be spatially resolvable by the LAT and provide a good calibration source to
demonstrate the efficacy of our tool.  We note that mpc-scale $\gamma$-ray
halos around AGNs have been hypothesized \citep{pair_halo_paper} which
could be resolved by the LAT However, no such halo has been discovered
in the LAT data so far.

Following 1FGL, the LAT collaboration published a list 
of sources that
had a high probability association with AGN 
called 1LAC \citep{first_agn_cat}.
1FGL had 709 1FGL sources associated with 671 distinct AGN at high
latitude ($|b|>10\deg$).  
Using two years of data and 2FGL, the LAT collaboration
associated 1016 2FGL sources
with AGN called 2LAC \citep{second_agn_cat}.
To avoid systematic problems with AGN classification, we
selected 885 out of the 1016 AGN which made it into the clean AGN sub-sample.  An AGN
association is considered clean only if it has a high probability
of association $P\ge 80\%$, if it is the only AGN associated with the
catalog source, and if there are no flags on the source in 2FGL. These
last two conditions are important for our analysis. Source
confusion may look like a spatially extended source and flagged catalog
sources may correlate with unmodeled structure in the diffuse emission.

Of the 885 clean AGN, we select 783 of these 2FGL sources which
are significantly-detected above 1 \gev and fit each of them for extension.
A histogram of the \tsext values computed for these AGN is
shown in figure~\ref{agn_ts_ext}. Overlaid on the plot is the
$\chi^2/2$ distribution of equation~\ref{ts_ext_distribution}.
The \tsext distribution for AGN shows good agreement with the
theoretical distribution.  Two sources had $\tsext>10$.  One was due
to incorrectly automatically removing a nearby catalog sources (see
section~\ref{extended_source_search_method}) and the other was due to a
failure of convergence of the point hypothesis.  This result demonstrates
that we can use \tsext as a measure of the statistical significance of
the detection of the extension of a source.

We should clarify that the LAT PSF used in this study was determined
empirically by fitting the observed shape of bright AGN (see
section~\ref{systematic_errors_on_extension}). Finding that the AGN we
test are not extended is not surprising.  This validation analysis is
not suitable to reject any hypotheses about the existence of mpc-scale
halos around AGN.

Nine extended sources not included in 2FGL were found using this search.
Three were found in our search using 1-100 \gev photons and six were
found in our search using 10-100 \gev photons.  The fit properties of
these nine sources is summarized in table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.
This table includes for each source the best fit position, extension,
spectrum, source significance, and significance of extension.

The results of our investigation of systematic uncertainties of this
measurement are presented in 
table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results}.  It
shows a comparison between the fit with a single extended source
hypothesis and the fit assuming the emission originates from two
independent sources and  the
results of the extension fit using variations of the PSF and the galactic
diffuse model described in section~\ref{systematic_errors_on_extension}.
There is good agreement between \tsext and the fit size using
the standard analysis, the alternative diffuse models, and the alternative PSF.
This suggests that the sources are robust against features in the diffuse
model and uncertainties in the angular resolution.

The source 2FGL\,J0823.0-4246 was found 
using 1-100 \gev photons to have an 
extension of $0.37\deg\pm0.03\deg_\stat\pm0.02\deg_\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of $\tsext=46.3$.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(260.32\deg,-3.28\deg)$.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248} shows a
counts map of this source.  This source is coincident with the one year
catalog source 1FGL\,J0823.3-4248.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL\,J0823.4-4305 and 2FGL\,J0821.0-4254 which are part of the
extended source.  We tested the source for source confusion by fitting
it as two point sources. Because $\tsinc=22.1$ is smaller then \tsext,
we conclude that this is an extended source.  These modifications are
shown in figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248}.

\begin{shaded}
This extended source is spatially coincident with the middle-aged
SNR Puppis A.  Puppis A has been studied in detail in radio
(\cite{puppis_a_vla}, and references therein) and  X-ray 
(\cite{rosat_puppis_a,suzaku_puppis_a}, and references therein)
The highest resolution image of the entire source was obtained
by \rosat and contours corresponding to this
image are overlaid on figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248} and match the
inferred \gev size \citep{rosat_puppis_a}.
Puppis A's distance was estimated at 2.2 kpc \citep{reynoso_1995,reynoso_2003}
which leads to a 1-100 \gev luminosity of $\approx 3\times 10^{34}$ ergs/\s.

No molecular clouds have been observed directly ajacent to Puppis A 
\citep{co_eastern_puppis_a}.
This is similar to the the LAT detected SNR the Cyngus Loop \citep{cygnus_loop_lat}.
The luminolsity of Puppis A is also smaller than that of 
other SNRs believed to interact with molecular clouds
\citep{w51c,ic443,w44,w28,w49b_lat}.
The \gev emission could therefore be explained by the interaction
of accelerated particles by interstellar matter or fields, similar
to the emission mechanism suggested for the Cygnus Loop SNR
\citep{cygnus_loop_lat}.

is seen in figure \ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c}.  To test for source confusion,
we also fit the source instead as two point sources. Since $\tsinc=20.0$
is smaller than \tsext, we conclude that this is an extended source.

\begin{shaded}
This source is in a region of remarkably complicated diffuse emission.
Even though it is 16\deg from the Galactic plane, the source is on
top of the core of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud which contains massive
star-forming regions that are bright in the infrared.  The region also has
abundant molecular and atomic gas traced by CO and HI but also plenty of
dark gas, the kind that we find only by its association with dust emission
\citep{isabelle_dark_gass}. Embedded star-forming regions make it even
more challenging to measure the column density of dust.  Infared and CO
contours are overlaid on figure~\ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c} and there is good
spatial correlation with the \gev emission \citep{iras_rho_ophiuci}.
Therefore this source might represent an inadequacy in the diffuse
$\gamma$-ray model

2FGL\,J0851.7-4635 is spatially coincident with the SNR Vela Jr.
Overlaid on figure~\ref{Vela_Jr} are contours of Vela Jr. as seen in
\tev by H.E.S.S \citep{vela_jr_hess}.  The \gev and \tev morphology
match well.  A detailed papers by the LAT collaboration on Vela Jr. is
in preparation.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove thee nearby catalog
sources 2FGL\,J0853.5-4711, 2FGL\,J0848.5-4535, and 2FGL\,J0855.4-4625
which are part of the extended source.  In addition, we relocalized
the position of the nearby catalog source 2FGL\,J0854.7-4501 to
$(l,b)=(266.24\deg,0.49\deg)$ to better fit its position at high energies
in the presence of of the extended source.  In addition, we removed the
further away catalog sources 2FGL\,J0858.0-4815 and 2FGL\,J0901.7-4655
because they were not significant above 10 \gev.  After modifying
the region, we found that \tsinc=16.1 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

The source 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051 was found using 10-100 \tev
photons to have an extension of $0.33\deg\pm0.04\deg_\stat\pm0.01\deg_\sys$
with an extension significance of \tsext=16.3.  The source
was fit to a position of $(l,b)=(332.38\deg,-0.14\deg)$.
This source is coincident with the one year catalog source
1FGL\,J1613.6-5100c. Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c} shows a counts map
of this source.

This source is less than 1\deg away from 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 which is
also spatially extended (see section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}).
To get a good fit of both sources, we had to model both sources as
being spatially extended and iteratively fit the position and extension
of each source until obtaining a global best fit.  Before doing this,
We removed from our model the source 2FGL\,J1614.9-5212 because it is
part of 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138's. Furthermore, we removed the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL\,J1619.7-5040c and 2FGL\,J1620.6-5111c because they were not
significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications are further described
in the caption to figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.  After modifying
the region, we found that \tsinc=11.9 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1616-508 \citep{hess_plane_survey}.  In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}, contours of HESS\,J1616-508 are overlaid
on 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051.  The H.E.S.S. experiment measured an
extension $0.136\pm 0.008$ when fitting the source with an elliptical
Gaussian surface brightness.  This size corresponds to a 68\% containment
radius of $\rsixeight=0.21\deg\pm0.01\deg$. This size is comparable to the LAT
size $\rsixeight=0.27\deg\pm0.03\deg$ (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051
connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1616-508.

\begin{shaded}
HESS\,J1616-508 is located in the region of two SNRs, RCW103
(G332.4-04) and Kes 32 (G332.4+0.1) but is not spatially coincident
with either of them \citep{hess_plane_survey}.  HESS\,J1616-508 is near
three pulsars PSR J1614-5048, PSR J1616-5109, and PSR J1617-5055
but only PSR J1617-5055 is energetically favored as being the \tev
emitter \citep{discovery_of_PSR_J1617-5055,integral_HESS_J1616-508}.
\cite{hess_plane_survey} speculated that a PWN powered by this young
pulsar could be responsible for the emission of HESS\,J1616-508.
Because HESS\,J1616-508 is 9' away from PSR J1617-5055, this would
require an assymetric X-ray PWNe to power the \tev emission. However,
\chandra ACIS observations revealed only an underluminous PWN of
about $\approx1'$ size around the pulsar which was not oriented
towards the \tev emission, rendering this association as uncertain
\citep{discovery_of_pwn_for_PSR_J1617-5055}.  No other promising
counterparts were observed in observations of x-ray and soft gamma-ray
emission by \suzaku \citep{suzakzu_HESS_J1616-508}, \swiftxrt,
IBIS/ISGRBI, BeppoSAX and \xmmnewton \citep{integral_HESS_J1616-508}.
Finally, \cite{discovery_of_pwn_for_PSR_J1617-5055} found diffuse
emission towards the center of HESS\,J1616-508 using archival radio and
infared observations.  Deeper observations will likely be necessary to
understand this region.

\subsection{2FGL\,J1615.2-5138}
\label{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}

The source 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 was found using 10-100 \gev
photons to have an extension of $0.42\deg\pm0.03\deg_\stat\pm0.01_\sys$
with an extension significance of \tsext=48.0.  The source was fit to a
position of $(l,b)=(331.66\deg,-0.66\deg)$.  This source is coincident
with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J1614.7-5138c.  Because 2FGL
J1615.2-5138 is close to 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051, the same model described
in section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.0-5051} was used to analyze both
sources. Both sources can be seen in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.
For 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138, \tsinc=37.0 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1614-518 \citep{hess_plane_survey}. In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}, contours of HESS\,J1614-518 are overlaid
on 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138.  The H.E.S.S. experiment measured a Gaussian
extension of $\sigma=0.23\deg\pm0.02\deg$ and $\sigma=0.15\pm0.02$
in the semi-major and semi-minor axis. This size corresponds
to a 68\% containment size of $\rsixeight=0.35\deg\pm0.03\deg$
and $0.23\pm0.03$.  This elliptical size matches the LAT size
$\rsixeight=0.35\deg\pm0.03\deg$.  Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows
that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 connects smoothly to
the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1614-518.  Further data collected by
H.E.S.S. in 2007 helped to resolve a double peaked structure in the
H.E.S.S. data but no spectral variation across the source, suggesting
that the emission is not the confusion of physically separate sources
\citep{closer_look_hess_j1614-518}.  The source was also detected by
CANGAROO-III \citep{cangaroo_j1614-518}.

\begin{shaded}
There are five nearby pulsars, but none are luminous enough to
provide the required energy output required to power the $\tev$ 
emission \citep{closer_look_hess_j1614-518}.  HESS\,J1614-518
is spatially coincident with a young open cluster Pismis 22
\citep{hess_1614_landi_atel,closer_look_hess_j1614-518}.
\suzaku detected two
promising x-ray candidates. Source A is an extended source consistent
with the peak of HESS\,J1614-518 and source B coincident with Pismis 22
and towards the center but in a relatively dim region of HESS\,J1614-518
\citep{suazku_hess_j1614_518}.  Three hypothesis have been presented to
explain this emission; either source A is an SNR powering the $\gamma$-ray
emission, source A is a PWN powered by an undiscovered pulsar in either
source A or B, and finally that the emission may arise from hadronic 
acceleration in the stellar winds of Pisim 22 \citep{cangaroo_j1614-518}.

The source 2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c was found 
using 10-100 \gev photons to
have an extension of $0.44\deg\pm0.04\deg_\stat\pm0.03\deg_\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of \tsext=64.5.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(336.41\deg,0.22\deg)$.  This source is coincident with the one
year catalog source 1FGL\,J1632.9-4802c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}
shows a counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove from our model
three catalog sources 2FGL\,J1631.7-4720c, 2FGL\,J1630.2-4752,
2FGL J1634.4-4743c.4-4820c that were part of the extended source..
We then iteratively relocalized the source 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c
to $(l,b)=(337.230\deg,0.346\deg)$ and 2FGL\,J1636.3-4740c to
$(l,b)=(336.968\deg,-0.066\deg)$ while fitting the extension of
2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c.  In addition we removed from our model four
farther away two year catalog sources 2FGL\,J1638.0-4703c, 2FGL
J1628.1-4857c, 2FGL  J1630.1-4615, 2FGL\,J1639.8-4921c because they
were not significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications are shown
in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}.  To test for source confusion,
we compared the likelihood fitting this region as one extended source
to the likelihood fitting this region as two point sources. We found
$\tsinc=40.6$ which is less than \tsext so we conclude
that this is an extended source.

This extended source is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1632-478 \citep{hess_plane_survey}.
In figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}, contours of  HESS\,J1632-478
are overlaid on 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c.  H.E.S.S measured a 
extension of $\sigma=0.21\pm0.05$ and $0.06\pm0.04$ along the
semi-major and semi-minor axes when fitting the source with an
elliptical Gaussian surface brightness.  This corresponds to a 68\%
containment size $\rsixeight=0.31\deg\pm0.08\deg$ and $0.09\pm0.06$
along the semi-major and semi-minor axis. This size is consistent with
the LAT size $\rsixeight=0.36\deg\pm0.04\deg$.  Figure~\ref{hess_seds}
shows that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c connects smoothly to
the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1632-478.

\begin{shaded}
\cite{hess_plane_survey} argued that HESS\,J1632-478
is positionally coincident with the hard X-ray source
IGR\,J1632-4751 observed by INTEGRAL, \xmmnewton, and \asca
\citep{Igr_J16320-4751_circ,xmm_newton_IGR_J16320-4751,asca_plane_survey},
but this source is suspected to be an galactic X-Ray Binary so the $\gamma$-ray
extension disfavors the association.  Further observations by
\xmmnewton reveal extended emission of size $\approx32''\times15''$
and inside point-like emission coincident with the peak
H.E.S.S. emission \citep{hess_j1632_478_xmm_newton}.  They found
in archival MGPS-2 data a spatially coincident extended radio source
\citep{most_survey_galactic_plane}.  The positional match argues for a
single synchrotron processes producing X-ray and \gev and \tev radiation,
likely due to a PWNe.  The increased \gev and \tev size compared
to the X-ray size has previously been observed in several aging PWNe
including HESS\,J1825-137 \citep{hess_j1825_xmm_newton,hess_j1825_hess},
HESS\,J1640-465 \citep{hess_plane_survey,xmm_newton_hess_j_1640-466},
and Vela X \citep{vela_x_rosat,vela_x_hess}.  This can be explained by
a different synchrotron cooling time for the electrons producing X-rays
and \tev gamma rays.

The source 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c was found with 10-100 \gev photons to
have an extension of $0.35\deg\pm0.08\deg_\stat\pm0.03\deg_\sys$ with an
extension significance of $\tsext=18.8$.  The source was fit to a position
of $(l,b)=(25.08\deg,0.13\deg)$.  This source is coincident with the one
year catalog source 1FGL\,J1837.5-0659c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}
shows a counts map of this source.

This source is in a complicated region. There are three nearby
catalog sources 2FGL\,J1834.7-0705c, 2FGL\,J1836.8-0623c, and
2FGL\,J1839.3-0558c.  To get a good fit of 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c, we
relocalized 2FGL\,J1834.7-0705c to $(l,b)=(24.77\deg,0.50\deg)$,
2FGL\,J1836.8-0623c to $(l,b)=(25.57\deg,0.32\deg)$, and
2FGL\,J1839.3-0558c to $(l,b)=(26.08\deg,0.23\deg)$.  We removed the
nearby catalog source 2FGL\,J1835.5-0649 which is part of the extended
source and also the farther away catalog source 2FGL\,J1839.0-0539
because it was not significant above 10 \gev. These modifications are
shown in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}.  After modifying the region,
we found that \tsinc=12.6 which is less than \tsext, so we conclude that
the source is spatially extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the \tev source HESS\,J1837-069
\citep{hess_plane_survey}.  In figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}, contours
of HESS\,J1837-069 are overlaid on 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c. H.E.S.S. measured
an extension of $\sigma=0.12\pm0.02$ and $0.05\pm0.02$
along the semi-major and semi-minor axis when fitting the source
with an elliptical Gaussian surface brightness.  This corresponds
to a 68\% containment radius of $\rsixeight=0.18\deg\pm0.03\deg$ and
$0.08\deg\pm0.03\deg$ along the semi-major and semi-minor axis. The
size is comparable to LAT which fit a 68\% containment radius of
$\rsixeight=0.29\deg\pm0.07\deg$.  the size difference is not significant
(less than 2 sigma).  Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum
connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1837-069.

\begin{shaded}
HESS\,J1837-069 is coincident
with the hard and steady X-ray source AX J1838.0-0655
\citep{einstein_galactic_plane_survey,hard_x-ray_asca,integral_AX_J1838.0-0655,swift_follow_up,pulsations_HESS_J1837-069,suzaku_HESS_J1837-069}.
This source was discovery by RXTE to be a pulsar sufficiently
luminous to power the \tev emission.  AX J1838.0-0655 was spatially
resolved by \chandra to be a bright point source surrounded by
a $\sim2'$ nebula \citep{pulsations_HESS_J1837-069} and so the
$\gamma$-ray emission may be powered by this pulsar.  A second
X-ray point source AX J1837.3-0652 is in the region of HESS\,J1837-069
\citep{hard_x-ray_asca,swift_follow_up,pulsations_HESS_J1837-069,suzaku_HESS_J1837-069}.
It was also resolved into point-like and diffuse component
although no pulsations have yet been detected from it
\citep{pulsations_HESS_J1837-069}.  If AX J1838.0-0655 is a pulsar/PWN
powering HESS\,J1837-069, some of the \tev emission may also come from
AX J1837.3-0652.

The source 2FGL\,J2021.5+4026 was found with 10-100 \gev
photons to have an extension of $0.59\deg\pm0.03\deg_\stat\pm0.02\deg_\sys$
with an extension significance of $\tsext=116.4$.  The source was
fit to a position of $(l,b)=(78.18\deg,2.19\deg)$.  This source
is coincident with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J2020.0+4049.
Figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049} shows a counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
source 2FGL\,J2019.1+4040 which were part of the extended source.
Further, we found it necessary to add an additional point source not in
the two year catalog into our background model.  The new source is was
localized to a position of $(l,b)=(78.85\deg,2.67\deg)$ and had $\ts=13.5$ .
Although the source is not very significant, not including it into the
background model appeared visually to significantly throw off the fit
of the region.  In addition, we removed the four further away catalog
sources 2FGL\,J2022.8+3843c, 2FGL\,J2020.0+4159, 2FGL\,J2013.8+4115c,
and 2FGL\,J2012.4+3955c from the region because they were not significant
above 10 \gev.  After modifying the region, we found that \tsinc=24.3
which is less than \tsext, so we believe that this source is spatially
extended.  These modifications are further described in the caption to
figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049}.

This source is spatially coincident with the $\gamma$ Cygni SNR.  Contours of
$\gamma$ Cygni at 408MHz from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey are overlaid
on figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049} and there is good spatial agreement
with the LAT emission \citep{canadian_galactic_plane_survey}.

\section{Discussion}

2FGL reported on the detection of twelve sources
prviously known as extended. Using
two years of LAT data and a new analysis method, we present on 
the detection of nine additional extended sources. We also reanalyze
the spatial shape of the extended sources in 2FGL.  Finding a coherent
source extension with different frequencies, especially at \tev energies,
allows us to firmly associate the LAT source in many cases.

The position of the 21 extended LAT sources are close to the Galactic
plane and plotted in figure~\ref{allsky_extended_sources}.  Most of the
extended sources are indeed expected to be of Galactic origin as the
distance of extragalactic sources (with exception of the local group
Galaxies) is typically too large to resolve them in gamma rays.


Figure~\ref{compare_index_2FGL} shows a comparison of the spectral index
of LAT detected extended sources and of all sources in 2FGL. This, and
table~\ref{known_extended_sources} and~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table},
show that the LAT observes a population of hard (index $<2$)
extended sources above 10 \gev which connects to \tev sources.
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows the LAT energy spectrum of four of the
extended sources which were first discovered in the H.E.S.S. Galactic
plane survey \citep{hess_plane_survey} and have a matching size to LAT
extended sources.  The LAT energy spectrum connects smoothly to \tev.
This is also true of HESS\,J1825-137 \citep{fermi_hess_j1825} and RX
J1713.7-3946 \citep{rx_j1713_lat}. 

For the LAT extended sources also seen in \tev,
figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_plot} shows a comparison of their sizes.  There is
a good correlation between the \gev and \tev sizes of the sources. Even
so, the size of PWNe are expected to vary across the \gev and \tev energy
range and the size of HESS\,J1825-137 was seen by H.E.S.S. to vary
between 200 \gev and 20 \tev \citep{energy_dependent_hess_j1825}.
HESS\,J1825-137 is significantly larger in \gev than \tev
\citep{fermi_hess_j1825}.  It is interesting to compare the \gev and
\tev size of other PWN candidates, but definitively measuring this 
would require a more in-depth analysis of the LAT data using the same 
elliptical surface brightness model.

Figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_histogram} compares the size of the 21 extended
LAT sources to the 42 extended H.E.S.S. sources.  Because of the large
field of view and all-sky coverage, the LAT can more easily measure
larger sources including the LMC and SMC.  On the other hand, the smaller
angular resolution of Air Cherenkov detectors allows them to measure a
population of extended sources below our sensitivity limit (currently at
about $\approx0.2\deg$).  Fermi has a five year nominal livetime with a
goal of ten years of operation.  As figure~\ref{time_sensitivity} shows,
our sensitivity to these smaller sources will improve by a factor greater
than $\sqrt{t}$.  With increased exposure, the LAT will likely begin to
resolve these smaller \tev sources.

symmetric intensity distribution. \glon and \glat are Galactic longitude
and latitude of the best fit extended source respectively.  The first
error on $\sigma$ is statistical and the second is systematic (see

    of W30, 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c, 2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c,
    2FGL\,J1615.0-5051, and 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 \citep{hess_plane_survey}.
    The \tev extensions of MSH 15-52, HESS\,J1825-137, Vela X,
    Vela Jr., RX J1713.7-3946 and W28 are from 
    \citep{msh_15_52_hess,hess_j1825_hess,vela_x_hess,vela_jr_hess,rx_j1713_hess,w28_hess}.
    The \tev extension of IC443 is from \citep{ic443_veritas}
    and W51c is from \citep{w51c_with_magic_at_fermi_symposium}.
    The LAT extension of Vela X is from \citep{velax}.  Except for RX
    J1713.7-3946 Vela Jr., the \tev sources were fit assuming a Gaussian
    surface brightness so the plotted \gev and \tev extensions were first
    converted to \rsixeight (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
    Because of their large size, the shape of RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr.
    were not directly fit in \tev. Here, we take their
    sizes to be the same as the LAT size and 
    do not converted it to \rsixeight. The LAT extension errors are
    the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature. The \tev size of MSH 15-52, HESS\,J1614-518,
    HESS\,J1632-478, and HESS\,J1837-069 have only been reported with
    an elliptical Gaussian fit and so the plotted size is the average
    of semi-major and semi-minor axis.

    brightness model and

    morphology of RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr. is poorly matched by a
    Gaussian surface brightness model, the \gev and
    \tev extensions are assuming a uniform surface brightness.
