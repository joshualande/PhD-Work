\begin{abstract}
We present a new method for analyzing spatially extended sources with
the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the
{\em Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. Measuring the extension
of a LAT source is important for uniquely identifying it.  We provide
a series of Monte Carlo studies to validate this tool and calculate
the LAT's detection threshold to spatially extended sources.  We then
apply this tool to test all sources in the two year source catalog for
extension. We present on the detection of nine spatially extended sources
in addition to the twelve spatially extended sources reported in the
second Fermi LAT Catalog (2FGL).

\section{Introduction}

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair conversion telescope on the
Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (Fermi). It has been surveying the
$\gamma$-ray sky since June 2008.  Fermi is well suited as a survey
instrument because of its broad energy coverage (20 \mev to $>300$
\gev), wide field of view ($\sim 2.4 \sr$), and large effective area
($\sim 8000 \cm^2$ at $>1 \gev$).

Using two years of all sky surveying data, the LAT Collaboration
published a catalog of 1873 \gev sources\cite{second_cat}. Many of these can
be positionally associated with a variety of source classes including
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), pulsars, galaxies, and supernova
remnants (SNRs).  While many of these classes can be spatially
resolved when observed at other frequencies, detection an extension at
GeV energies by the LAT is complicated by the rather large
point-spread function (PSF) of the instrument (the angular resolution
for events converting in the front part of the detector, defined as
the 68\% containment radius for a point source, is approximately
$3.5^{\circ}$ at 100 MeV, improving to about 0.1$^{\circ}$ at 10 GeV).

Several of these source classes are extended (and close) enough to
potentially be extended. In particular supernova remnants, pulsar wind
nebulae, molecular clouds, normal galaxies, galaxy clusters or dark
matter satellites can (in favorable cases) be expected to be extended
beyond the LAT's PSF. The LAT collaboration has previously reported on
the discovered of five spatially extended supernova remnants, IC443,
W28, W44, W51C, and RX J1713.7-3946
(\cite{ic443,w28,w44,w51c,rx_j1713_lat}). In addition, three extended
pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) were detected: MSH 15-52, Vela~X, and
HESS\,J1825-137 (\cite{msh1552,velax,fermi_hess_j1825}), as well as
two close-by galaxies, the Large Magellanic and Small Magalenic Cloud
(\cite{lmc,smc}), and finally the radio galaxy Centarus A
(\cite{cen_a_lat}) .

In addition to these GeV $\gamma$-ray detections, a variety of
spatially extended sources have been detected in the Galactic plane at
\tev energies using Air Cherenkov detectors. Most prominent was a
survey of the Galactic plane using the High Energy Stereoscopic System
(H.E.S.S) which presented 14 spatially extended sources
(\cite{hess_plane_survey}) sources with extensions varying from
$~0.1\deg$ to $~0.25\deg$. In fact, within our Galaxy only very few
sources (most notably the $\gamma$-ray binaries
LS\,5039\cite{HESSLS5039}, LS I+61-303\cite{MAGICLSI, VERITASLSI} and
HESS\,J0632+057\cite{HESS0632} are amongst the few Galactic sources
for which no significant extension was detected at \tev
energies. Given these findings, it can be expected that if the source
population at GeV energies has similar properties, that at least some
of the Fermi-LAT sources in our Galaxy should be spatially extended at
GeV energies.

Being able to spatially resolve the \gev emission from a source is
important for several reasons. Because of the large PSF and the large
candidate source density in our Galaxy, source confusion is a severe
problem for the Fermi-LAT. Finding a matching morphology can be used
to uniquely identify the source.  Because of the strongly varying PSF
of the LAT, the spatial and spectral information about a source do not
simply decouple. Therefore, a biased spatial model will bias the
spectral model of the source and studying the extension of the source
can correct for this.  Furthermore, correctly modeling a source's
extension is important for improving the overall model of the sky and
removing excess residuals.  These residuals manifested themselves in
1FGL as spurious point sources in the region region surrounding the
Large Magellanic Cloud (\cite{first_cat}).  For this reason, we are
motivated to take the 1873 sources that were detected in 2FGL and
apply a search for those sources which are spatially extended.

\section{Analysis Methods}

Morphological studies of sources in the \gev energy range
using the LAT are challenging because of the significantly 
energy-dependent PSF and because of systematic errors in the Galactic diffuse
emission.  The LAT's PSF is determined at lower energies by multiple
scattering in the tracker and the 68\% containment radius of the PSF is
approximately 5.1\deg at 100 \mev  when averaged over instrument acceptance
and including photons which convert in either the thick or thin layers of
the tracker. The PSF approaches a limit given by the granularity of the
tracker channels and is 0.14\deg at 10 \gev (\cite{on_orbit_calibration}).
Therefore, the higher energy photons are significantly more important for
resolving a source but are typically limited by statistics. 
A detailed analysis procedure must be used to maximize our
sensitivity over all energies.

\subsection{The \pointlike Package}

A new analysis tool has been developed to address the unique requirements
for studying spatially extended sources with the LAT. The tool
provides a maximum likelihood analysis where the Poisson likelihood
for observing the measured counts is maximized by fitting
parameters of the model.  The extension of a source can be modeled by a
geometric shape (e.g. a disk or Gaussian) and the source's position
and extension can be simultaneously fit.

This analysis is not feasible using the official LAT likelihood
analysis tool \gtlike\footnote{\gtlike is distributed publicly by the
Fermi Science Support Center (\cite{fssc})} because \gtlike can only 
fit the spectral parameters of the model. The extension fitting would
have to be done as an external loop which would typically be
too time consuming. What has typically
been done to study an extended sources is to fix the position of the
source and develop a profile of the likelihood as a
function of extension.  This approach is not optimal because the
position and extension of the source should be simultaneously maximized
to find the best fit parameters and to correctly compute the statistical
significance of the detection.  Furthermore since this approach is
computationally intensive, no large-scale Monte Carlo effort can
be run to validate it.

We developed an alternative approach to fit spatially extended
sources. A separate maximum likelihood fitting package called
\pointlike has been developed by the LAT collaboration and we have
added to it the ability to analyze spatially extended sources. \pointlike
is described in 1FGL and in Matthew Kerr's Ph.D thesis
(\cite{first_cat,matthew_kerr_thesis}).  

What differentiates \pointlike most significantly from \gtlike is its
emphasis on speed by introducing approximations into the calculation
of the likelihood function while trying to minimized the introduced
numerical errors.  Like the binned version of \gtlike, \pointlike bins
the sky in both position and energy.  Unlike \gtlike, \pointlike relies on
the {\em healpix} representation of spatial bins (\cite{healpix}). Since
the PSF changes significantly with energy, the spatial size of each bin
is chosen to be smaller than the PSF. By changing the spatial
bin size with energy, \pointlike ensures that little information is lost
at each energy while minimizing the required number of bins.

\pointlike also bins $\gamma$-rays depending upon whether they convert
in the thin or thick layers of the tracker. Since the PSF is smaller for
photons which convert in the thin layers of the tracker,
photons are also binned depending upon where they 
convert in the tracker.
Furthermore, \pointlike
uses a sparse matrix representation of the spatial bins where only the
bins with counts in them are used. To evaluate the likelihood, \pointlike
then independently integrates the model predicted counts in the region.

Intelligent binning and a sparse matrix representation of the data
effectively interpolates between a binned analysis at low energy (where
the resolution is poor and there are many counts) and an unbinned
analysis at high energy (where the resolution is good but there are
few counts). This approach provides significant savings in time while
introducing only small numerical error.

\subsection{Extension Fitting}
\label{extension_fitting}

In \pointlike, it is assumed that the spatial and spectral model
of an extended source decouple and that the spatial shape can be
represented by a two dimensional function.  To fit the extended source,
\pointlike convolves the extended source shape with the PSF (as a
function of energy) and uses the \minuit fitting library to maximize
the likelihood by simultaneously fitting the position and extension
of the source (\cite{minuit_documentation}).  As will be described in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}, simultaneously fitting the position
and extension is necessary to correctly calculate the statistical
significance of the detection of extension.  For each position and
extension, the spectral parameters of the sky model are refit. To avoid
projection effects, what is directly fit is not the longitude and latitude
but instead the source's displacement in a rotated reference frame.

The significance of the extension of a source can be calculated from
\tsext, which is defined as twice the increase in log likelihood (\loglikelihood)
between
the extended source model at its best fit values and the point source
model at its best fit values:
\begin{equation}
  \tsext=2\log(\loglikelihood_\text{ext}/\loglikelihood_\text{ps}).
\end{equation}
\pointlike calculates \tsext by fitting a source first with a spatially
extended model and then as a point source.  The interpretation
of \tsext in terms of a statistical significance is discussed in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}.

The convolution of radially symmetric extended sources is optimized by
using a semi-analytic calculation.  The observed photon distribution
can be written as the convolution of the source shape ($I_\text{src}$)
with the psf
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(\vec r) = \int  \text{PSF}(|\vec r - \vec r'|)I_\text{src}(\vec r') d A'.
\end{equation}
For the LAT, the PSF is parameterized by a {\em King function}
\begin{equation}
  \text{PSF}(\vec r) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}
  \left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left(1+\frac{u}{\gamma}\right)^{-\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ are free parameters
(\cite{matthew_kerr_thesis}).  For radially symmetric extended sources,
the angular part of the integral can be done analytically
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(u)= \int_0^\infty dv
  I_\text{src}(v) 
  \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma + u + v}\right)^\gamma 
  \times ~_2F_1 \left(\gamma/2,\frac{1+\gamma}{2},1,\frac{4uv}{(\gamma+u+v)^2}\right).
\end{equation}
This convolution formula is used by \pointlike because it is faster
and more closely reduces to the PSF when the source's size is 
small.

There will always be a small numerical discrepancy between the PSF and
a very small extended source due to numerical error in the convolution.
In most situations, this error would be insignificant. But when testing
a source for extension, this offset can significantly bias the estimate
of the significance of the extension of a source.  To correct for this,
when testing a source for extension we compare the likelihood fitting
the source with an extended shape to the likelihood fitting it with its
extension fixed to ${10^{-10}}\deg$.

\subsection{Extension Errors}
\label{extension_error}

Errors on fit parameters are typically calculated in one of two
ways. The first method requires explicitly varying a parameter
while simultaneously optimizing the other parameters
until the log of the likelihood has fallen by a particular value.
The \minuit fitting
package provides the {\em Simplex} function to calculate errors this way
(\cite{minuit_documentation}).  The second method involves estimating the
likelihood function as being a multivariate Gaussian and calculating the
curvature of the log of the likelihood at the peak to estimate when the
function will decrease by the desired value. \minuit provides the {\em HESSE}
algorithm to calculate errors this way.  {\em HESSE} errors 
can be calculated significantly faster.

We found that the {\em HESSE} errors on the extension of a source
were sometimes badly estimated.  On the other hand, the {\em Simplex}
algorithm was prohibitively slow and would often fail to convergence. Our
approach to calculating extension errors is to fix the position of the
source and varying just the extension using the {\em Simplex} algorithm.
This approach makes the approximation that the covariance between each
spatial parameter is small but not that the likelihood is Gaussian. This
method is shown schematically in figure~\ref{extension_profile} which
shows the change in \loglikelihood when varying the extension of the
SNR IC443.  The localization error is separately calculated by fixing
the extension and spectrum of the source and fitting a parabola to the
likelihood as a function of position.

\subsection{\gtlike Crosscheck}
\label{gtlike_crosscheck}

\pointlike is important for LAT analysis that require many iterations
such as source localization and extension fitting.  On the other hand,
because of the fewer approximations used in calculating the likelihood
we expect that the spectral parameters fit by \gtlike to be slightly
more precise.  Furthermore, because \gtlike is the standard likelihood
analysis package, it has been more extensively validated for spectral
analysis.  For that reason, in the following analysis  we use \pointlike
to determinate the position and extension of a source and then determine
the spectrum using \gtlike. Both \gtlike and \pointlike can estimate
the statistical significance of the extension of a source and we require
that both methods agree to claim a detection.

We found good agreement between the two methods. For the new extended
source candidates, table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} will shows a
comparison of \ts and \tsext computed using \pointlike and \gtlike.
Unless explicitly mentioned, all \ts, \tsext, and spectral parameters
were calculated using \gtlike using \pointlike's positions and extensions.

\subsection{Dual Localization}
\label{dual_localization_method}

There is a degeneracy between a spatially extended source and multiple
point sources.  To assess the possibility of source confusion,
we developed a function in \pointlike to simultaneously fit the position
of two point sources.  To improve the robustness of the fit, the sum and
difference of the positions of the two sources are fit in a coordinates
rotated to the equator.  The \loglikelihood is then maximized by fitting
the sum and difference of the positions.

We define \tsinc as twice the increase in \loglikelihood fitting the
region as two point sources compared to fitting the region as one point
source: \begin{equation}
  \tsinc=2\times(\loglikelihood_\text{2pts}-\loglikelihood_\text{ps}).
\end{equation} \tsinc can not be directly compared to \tsext to see
which model is more significant because the models are not nested
(\cite{statistics_with_care}). Even though the comparison of \tsext
with \tsinc is not a calibrated test, we find the extreme cases $\tsinc
\loglikelihood \tsext$ or $\tsinc\gg\tsext$ to be suggestive and we only
consider a source to be extended if $\tsext>\tsinc$.

Like extended sources described in section~\ref{gtlike_crosscheck},
the spectrum of the two point sources can be refit using \gtlike.
we quote the spectral values obtained from \gtlike using the best fit
positions found using \pointlike.  For the extended candidates found
by our search, we computed both \tsext and \tsinc.  The results will be
presented in table~\ref{dual_localization_results}.

\subsection{Comparing Source Sizes}

\label{compare_source_size}

The spatial shape of extended sources can be modeled
as a two dimensional Gaussian
\begin{equation}\label{gauss_pdf}
  \text{PDF}(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}\exp\left(-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma^2\right)
\end{equation}
or a uniform disk
\begin{equation}\label{disk_pdf}
  \text{PDF}(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{\pi\sigma^2}\delta\left(x^2+y^2<\sigma^2\right).
\end{equation}
Although these shapes are significantly different, the convolution of them
with the PSF look similar.  Figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss} demonstrates
this by showing the PSF, PDF, and convolution of the PDF with the PSF
for a uniform disk and Gaussian spatial model of size 0.5\deg.  This plot
shows that we are not very sensitive to probing the exact structure of an
extended source.  In the following we assume a uniform disk spatial model.

To get the convolved shapes to match in figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss},
we had to set them to predict the same 68\% containment
radius of 0.5\deg.  The 68\% containment radius for a
spatial model is the radius at which 68\% of the intensity is
enclosed.  It can be computed by a straightforward integral
and we find that $\rsixeight_\text{,Gaussian}=1.51\sigma$
whereas $\rsixeight_\text{,disk}=0.82\sigma$ where $\sigma$
is defined in equation~\ref{disk_pdf} for the Gaussian source and
equation~\ref{gauss_pdf} for the disk source.  Since $\rsixeight=0.5\deg$,
the uniform disk has $\sigma=0.41\deg$ and the Gaussian has
$\sigma=0.75\deg$.

This is important when comparing morphologies to other wavelengths
because the quoted size can vary significantly depending on which quantity
is reported.  This effect can be best seen in figure~\ref{compare_r68}
which a counts map of an extended source simulated in the energy
range from 1 \gev to 100 \gev with a uniform disk spatial model with
an extension $\sigma$ of 0.5. Overlaid on the plot is the fit extension
assuming the source has a uniform disk and a Gaussian spatial model. The
plot overlays both $\sigma$ and $\rsixeight$ and $\sigma$ is significantly
larger for the disk spatial hypothesis compared to the Gaussian spatial
model. On the other hand, the disk and Gaussian's 68\% containment radius
are similar.

Since we are not very sensitive to the particular morphology of an
extended source, there is no correct choice for which size to quote
or which shape to overlay. For the following analysis, we quote the
disk's edge and overlay this size.  But due to smearing of the PSF,
$\sigma$ typically looks larger than the observed counts distribution.
When comparing the fit extensions with other wavelengths, it is important
to compare consistent quantities.


\section{LAT Extended Source Validation}


\subsection{Significance of Extension}
\label{monte_carlo_validation}

We validated \pointlike's extension fitting code with a Monte Carlo
study. \tsext (defined in section~\ref{extension_fitting}) can be used to calculate the statistical significance
of the extension of a source.  Since the point source and extended source models are
nested, an extended source must always fit as well as a point source.  On the other hand, we would
not expect the likelihood to change very much unless the source was
significantly extended.  Since an extended source has one additional
degree of freedom, Wilks' Theorem predicts that the distribution of $\tsext$
when testing a point source for extension should follow a $\chi^2_1$
distribution (\cite{wilks_theorem}).

However, since the null hypothesis rests on the edge of
parameter space when the extension is 0, Wilks' Theorem does not hold
(\cite{warn_wilks_theorem}).  One might expect the actual distribution
to be a half $\chi^2_1$ distribution with one degree of freedom plus
half a delta function at 0:
\begin{equation}
  P(\ts)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\chi^2_1(\ts)+\delta(\ts)).
\end{equation}
Chernoff proved that under certain assumptions this is the correct distribution
when the null hypothesis is on the edge of parameter
space (\cite{chernoff}).  The false detection
probability can be estimated by integrating this function from an observed
test statistic value to infinity. It is for this particular distribution
that the often quoted result holds that $\sqrt{\ts}$ is a measure of
the number of $\sigma$ of the detection (\cite{mattox_egret}).

The half $\chi^2_1$ distribution was found to hold for the special case
of source finding using EGRET (\cite{mattox_egret}). This distribution
is also plausible when testing point sources for extension. Due to
statistical fluctuations, half of the point sources might look narrower
than the PSF leading to $\tsext=0$. The other half of the time, we would
get a distribution consistent with Wilk's theorem. We will present a
Monte Carlo study that shows an empirical distribution of \tsext in the
null hypothesis and compares it to this distribution.

We simulated point sources of varying spectral models and fit them
them using \pointlike as both point and extended sources. The data was
simulated using \gtobssim\footnote{\gtobssim is distributed
by the Fermi Science Support Center (\cite{fssc}).}
The point sources were simulated with a power-law spectral model with
six $>100$ \mev fluxes ranging from $3\times 10^{-9} \ph/\cm^2/\sec$ to
$10^{-6} \ph/\cm^2/\sec$.  The point sources were simulated with spectral
indices ($\gamma$) of 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3.  These values were picked to
to represent typical source paramters in LAT-detected sources. The point
sources were simulated on top of an isotropic power-law background
with a Sreekumar-like spectrum ($>100$ \mev flux of $1.5\times 10^{-5}$ and spectral
index 2.1) (\cite{sreekumar_isotropic}).  The Monte Carlo simulation was
performed over a one year time interval using a default rocking profile
and a representative livetime fraction of 0.8.  The reconstruction was
performed with photons from an energy range of 1 \gev to 100 \gev using 4
energy bins per decade and using the 
Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6) Source Instrument
Response Function (IRFs).  For each point source, we used \pointlike
to fit it as both a point and extended source and calculate \tsext and
we only kept the sources which had a significant point source detection
($\ts>25$).


For most of the spectral models, ~30,000 statistically independent
simulations were performed. For the dimmer spectral models, many of the
simulations had $\ts<25$ and were discarded.  Table~\ref{ts_ext_num_sims}
shows the different spectral models used in our study as well as the
number of simulations.  The cumulative density of \tsext is plotted in
figure~\ref{ts_ext_mc}. The $\chi^2_1/2$ distribution suggested by Wilks'
Theorem is overlaid for comparison.

Our Monte Carlo study shows broad agreement between simulations and Wilks'
theorem. Nevertheless, the agreement is not perfect.  It should be noted
that the discrepancy seems to be worst for bright sources which seems to
imply that numerical errors in the convolution become more apparent for
sufficiently bright sources.  Other possible reasons for departure from
Wilks' theorem might include \pointlike ignoring energy dispersion which
would change the PSF's shape as a function of energy. But we emphasize
that most of the time, our empirical curve lies to the left of the
theoretical curve so using the theoretical distribution would lead to an
underestimate of the statistical significance of a detection. Therefore,
we are confident that $\sqrt{\tsext}$ can be used as a measure of the
statistical significance of a source's extension and use it in the
following analysis.

\section{Extended Source Detection Threshold}\label{extension_sensitivity}

We performed a second study to determine the LAT's detection
threshold to spatially extended sources. The detection threshold
to extension is defined as the flux at which the average
value of $\tsext$ is $\langle\tsext\rangle=25$. As was seen in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}, this corresponds to an extension
significance of $5\sigma$.  Qualitatively, we expect the LAT would not
be sensitive to sources much smaller than the PSF or much larger than
the PSF.  Small sources would look too much like the PSF and larger
sources would get lost in the background due to low surface brightness.

To calculate the LAT's detection threshold to spatially extended
sources, we simulated sources with a uniform radially symmetric disk
spatial model on top of a power-law Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum
(\cite{sreekumar_isotropic}).  The Monte Carlo simulation was performed
using the same one year time interval as in section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}.
For each extension and spectral index, we
first picked a flux range which bracketed $\tsext=25$. We then picked
ten flux points in this range and repeatedly simulated and performed
extension tests of the extended sources.  For each flux, we performed
$>15$ independent simulations and extension fits.  We calculated
$\langle\tsext\rangle=25$ by fitting a line to all the flux and
$\tsext$ values and estimating the flux when $\tsext=25$.

Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows the threshold for sources of four
spectral indices from 1.5 to 3 and extension varying from $\sigma=0.1\deg$
to $2.0\deg$.  The curves on the plot represent the flux for a given
extension where $\langle\tsext\rangle=25$. 
This results shows that the LAT's threshold to extension is better for
harder sources with more high energy photons. This result also shows
that the threshold is best for sources with an extension of $~0.5\deg$
and is significantly worse for very small extended small.

Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows the threshold using photons with
energies between 100 \mev and 100 \gev and also only using photons
with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev.  Except for the hardest
and largest sources, our detection threshold is almost unchanged when
including photons with energies between 100 \mev and 1 \gev.  This is also
demonstrated in figure~\ref{ts_ext_vs_energy} which shows \tsext for the
SNR IC443 computed independently in twelve energy bins between 100 \mev and
100 \gev. For IC443, which has a spectral index ~2.4, almost the entire
increase in \ts comes from energies above 1 \gev.  On the other hand,
other systematic errors become increasingly important at low energy. For
our extension search, we use only only photons with energy above 1 \gev.

Figure~\ref{diff_factor_sensitivity} shows how the LAT's detection
threshold varies with increasing diffuse background. We compute the
sensitivity for a power-law source of spectral index 2 using 1, 10, and
100 times the extragalactic background. The latter factor approximately
represents the intensity of the Galactic diffuse emission near the
Galactic center.  The figure shows two plots, the first showing the
threshold using only photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev and
the second showing the threshold using only photons with energies between
10 \gev and 100 \gev. This plot demonstrates that we are less sensitive
to extended sources in a higher background region and that if the flux of
a source is constant (same number of photons), we would be more sensitive
to the extension of that source if those photons had a higher energy.

\section{Extended Source Search Method}

2FGL is a list of 1873 \gev sources detected by the LAT.  2FGL included
twelve previously published spatially extended sources but did not
attempt to fit the extension of these sources. Other than these sources,
all 2FGL sources were modeled as point sources and 2FGL did not attempt to
resolve the extension of new sources.  In this paper, we tested all 2FGL
sources for extension to search for new spatially extended \gev sources.

For this search, we build a model of the
sky consistent with 2FGL.   We used the same two
years of data from August 4, 2008 to August 1, 2010 and we used the same
Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6) Source class event selections and 
Instrument Response Functions (IRFs, \cite{lat_on_orbit_psf}).  We used the same Galactic diffuse,
isotropic diffuse, and earth limb emission model. The spectrum of the
Galactic and isotropic diffuse models were refit during the analysis
while the earth limb emission was fixed to it's predicted value.

As was shown, we gain little in sensitivity using photons with energies
below 1 \gev. On the other hand, the large PSF at low energy makes us
more susceptible to systematic errors arising from source confusion due
to multiple point sources and susceptible to incorrect modeling of the
Galactic diffuse emission. In addition, the Galactic diffuse emission
is more pronounced at lower energies due to its steep energy spectrum.
For that reason, we performed our search using photons only between 1
\gev and 100 \gev.  We used 4 energy bins per each logarithmic decade
in energy.

We also performed a search for extended sources using photons only between
10 \gev and 100 \gev. Even though we are testing the same sources, this
approach is complimentary because the Galactic diffuse emission is even
less dominant above 10 \gev. Furthermore, source confusion becomes less of
a problem since most LAT sources are not significant at energies above 10
\gev.  Using higher energies, we might expect to detect harder sources in
more complicated regions. This is especially beneficial
for regions near pulsars which cutoff before 10 \gev
and was successfully used in detecting HESS J1825-137
and MSH 15-52 with the LAT (\cite{msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}).

For each catalog source, we tested it for extension using \pointlike
assuming the source had a uniform radially symmetric disk spatial model.
We used a circular $10\deg$ region of interest centered on our source and
included all catalog sources within $15\deg$ of the source of interest.
We refit the spectral parameters of sources within $2\deg$ of the source.
We modeled each source with a power-law spectral model. This was reasonable because for a source to be significantly
extended, it would have to be fairly hard and fit reasonably well by
a power-law. Second, since we began the analysis at either 1 \gev or
10 \gev, we didn't expect there to be significant curvature over this
energy range.

Finally, when analyzing the region, we automatically removed other
2FGL sources which were within 0.5\deg of the source of interest. This was done because of
a concern that extended sources would end up 2FGL as
multiple point sources. These spurious sources would then
distort the extension fit.
For each extended candidate, we performed a dual localization procedure
(described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method} to test if the
source is extended. We select the sources where $\tsext>16$.

\subsection{Additional Analysis}

Since extragalactic sources are typically too far away to be resolvable,
we expect most extended sources to be inside our Galaxy and most
likely on the Galactic plane.  Unfortunately, the \gev emission
in the Galactic plane is dominated by extremely structured Galactic
diffuse emission.  Finding sources on top of this emission is difficult
(\cite{first_diffuse_paper}) as has been discussed in 1FGL and 2FGL
(\cite{first_cat,second_cat}).  Furthermore, the Galactic plane is crowded
so it is often difficult to model nearby sources.  Because of this,
finding a source with $\tsext>16$ is not a sufficient for finding
an extended source and we have to perform several analysis crosschecks.

% 2FGL J1856.2+0450c = P72Y3047 for
As an example of why this is important, we describe the test of 2FGL
J1856.2+0450c for extension.  Figure~\ref{example_bad_fit} shows
a smoothed counts map using photons with energy above 1 \gev. In
the map, the Galactic and isotropic diffuse emission are subtracted.
A 2FGL source 2FGL J1856.2+0450c was found at the position
$(l,b)=(37.25\deg,0.84\deg)$.  We find that there appears to be overall
some large-scale residual in the diffuse emission along the Galactic
plane. As a result, 2FGL J1856.2+0450c fits to a
large extension of 1.83\deg and the result is statistically significant
with \tsext=103.6 (using \pointlike).  By looking at the residuals, it is clear that this
complicated region is not well fit even though the source's extension is
statistically significant. For this reason, we have to perform a series
of further analysis for all of the sources that are found with \tsext=16.
% information came from
% /nfs/slac/g/ki/ki03/lande/extended_catalog/2FGL/v15/standard_analysis/spectral_emin_1000_v1/P72Y3047/v1/results_followup_P72Y3047.yaml

First, we took the spatial and spectral model found using \pointlike
and performed a crosscheck by refitting the spectral parameters using
\gtlike.  We used a square ROI $14.1\deg$ in diameter with $1/16\deg$
pixels and the same energy binning as \pointlike. Using \gtlike, we found a second measure of \tsext,
this time not fitting the extension but using a fixed template
with extension determined by \pointlike.
We only considered a source to be significantly extended if \pointlike
and \gtlike both agreed.  For the new extended source candidates, 
table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} shows a comparison of their the value
of \tsext found by \gtlike and \pointlike.  Everywhere else, the values
from \gtlike are used.

Additionally, we generated for each extended source candidate residual
test statistic (\ts) maps.  The residual \ts map is the \ts value
evaluated at each grid point by adding a new source of spectral index
2 and finding the increase in likelihood when fitting its flux. \ts
maps are especially useful when looking for new sources or other
residual features that are not included in the model. The downside
is they are biased to look for residual features that look like
the PSF and so are not as sensitive to large-scale diffuse features.
features. Furthermore, by definition $\ts>0$ so \ts maps only show
positive fluctuations. Figure~\ref{res_tsmaps} shows an example
residual \ts map for the extended source IC443.

For each candidate, we also generated counts slices. A counts slice
plots the sum of all counts in the longitudinal direction within 2\deg
in the latitudinal direction.  The same plot is also shown integrating
in the longitudinal direction.   An example counts slice is shows for the extended source
IC443 in figure~\ref{counts_slice}. 
On top of the plot is overlaid the model
predicted counts assuming the source has a disk spatial model, assuming
the source is a point source, and fitting just the diffuse emission in
the region. 
Counts slices were especially useful
for looking at how well the overall diffuse emission model fits the
region near the sources.

For each candidate, we also generated a radial integral of the data. This
plot shows the sum of all counts within a given distance from the
source's center. The plot is binned uniformly in $\Delta \theta^2$ so
that an isotropic background will be flat in the plot. On top of this
plot is overlaid the model predicted counts assuming the source has a
disk spatial model, assuming the source is a point source, and fitting
just the diffuse emission in the region. An example radial integral
is shown for the extended source IC443 in figure~\ref{radial_profile}.
This plot is best for comparing the observed counts to the PSF.

For each source, we make a Galactic and extragalactic diffuse emisison
subtracted smoothed counts map. Figure~\ref{smoothed_counts} shows an
example smoothed counts map for IC443. They are useful for qualitativly
assesing the background model.

Finally, for each source, we performed the dual localization method
described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method}.  We did so by
replacing the source with two sources each containing half of the original
flux and then using \pointlike to simultaneously fit the position and
spectrum of these sources.  We then used \gtlike to refit the spectrum of
these sources using the best fit positions. For the new extended sources
found, we summarize the results of this dual localization test and compare
the values of \tsext to \tsinc in table~\ref{dual_localization_results}.

Because of the high source density in the Galactic plane for promising
extended source candidates we often had to iteratively improve the model
of the background sources to obtain a good fit of the extended source.
Often, several catalog sources would fill in the emission of one
extended source and all but one of them would have to be removed from
the model. Similarly, the position of background sources would often
have to be refit once the extended source's extension was correctly
fit. Similarly, background sources were insignificant in the fit
energy range and had to be removed.  When the position and extension
of the sources couples strongly with the bacground catalog sources, we
iteratively fit the position and extended of all nearby sources until the
fit stabilized.  For each extended source, we describe what modifications
were required to the sky model to obtain a good fit of the region.

\subsection{Alternative Diffuse Model Crosscheck}
\label{alt_diff_model_description}

To estimate systematic errors due to uncertainty in the diffuse
emission background model, we performed a second
extension test of the candidates using
an alternative diffuse
model. The alternative model was based on the GALPROP\footnote{GALPROP
is a software package for calculating the Galactic $\gamma$-ray
emission based on a model of cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy. See
\url{http://galprop.stanford.edu/} for details and references} code
used in the LAT analysis of the isotropic diffuse emission
(\cite{isotropic_lat}).  
With this model,
we independently fit in the nearby region 
7 HI rings, 7 HII rings, the inverse component,
the E(B-V) residual, and the isotropic component of
the background ration.
All told, we fit in the region 18 individual templates along
with all source parameters during the analysis.

It is not expected that this diffuse model is more physical.
But adding degrees of freedom to the background model is a good
way to remove likely spurious sources which correlate with features in
the diffuse emission.  Therefore, this tests systematics that may
be due to incorrect modeling of the diffuse emission in the region.
The results of this fit for the new extended source candidates are shown
in table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results}. Overall, there is good agreement
between the \ts using the standard and alternative diffuse models, 
suggesting that the sources are robust against features in the
diffuse model.


\section{Validation of Known Extended Sources}
\label{validate_known}

We first present on our analysis of the twelve extended sources
included in 2FGL.
(\cite{second_cat}).

% 6 SNRs The six extended SNRs IC443, W28, W30, W44, W51C, and the Cygnus
Loop were included in 2FGL.  IC443, W28, W44, W51C were first reported in
(\cite{ic443,w28,w44,w51c}).  Detailed papers by the LAT collaboration
studying W30 and the Cygnus Loop are still in preparation.  \gev emission
from W30 was also studied in (\cite{castro_and_slane_2010}).  Using photons
with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev, our analysis significantly
detected the extension
of all six SNRs. Table~\ref{known_extended_sources} shows the best fit
positions and extensions of these SNRs.

% 2 galaxies

In addition, two nearby galaxies the Large Magalenic Cloud and the
Small Magalenic Cloud were included in 2FGL (\cite{lmc,smc}).  They were
significantly detected using photons with energies between 1 \gev and
100 \gev. Our fit extension is comparable to the published result,
but we note that previous publication used a more complicated double
Gaussian spatial model when fitting the LMC.

% 3 PWN
Three pulsar wind nebula Vela X, MSH 15-52, and HESS J1825-137 were
included in 2FGL (\cite{velax,msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}).  Using photons
with energy above 10 \gev, we significantly detected the extension of
HESS J1825-137.  To improve the model of this source, we removed the
nearby catalog source 2FGL J1823.1-1338c which is part of the extended
source.  To avoid the nearby pulsar PSR J1509-5850, MSH 15-52 must be
analyzed at high energies.  Using photons with energies above 10 \gev,
we fit the extension of MSH 15-52 to be consistent with the published
size with an extension significance of \tsext=7.2.  Our analysis was
unable to resolve Vela X which would have required removing the pulsed
photons from the Vela pulsar. This is beyond the scope of this paper.

% 1 radio galaxy
Our analysis also failed to detect a significant extension for the
Centaurus A Lobes (\cite{cen_a_lat}). This is most likely because the
discovered emission was significantly more complicated than a uniform
radially symmetric Disk.  

The results are summarized in table~\ref{known_extended_sources}.
This table includes the best fit position and extension of these
sources when fitting them with a radially symmetric uniform disk spatial
model.  It also includes the best fit spectral model of each source.
The difficulty that out analysis had fitting the extension of several
of the already published extended sources should be used to emphasize
the overall difficultly in studying spatially extended sources in crowded
regions of the sky.

\section{Test of 1LAC Sources}
\label{test_1lac_sources}

To validate our method and assess systematic issues with our analysis,
we used \pointlike to test known AGN for extension.
\gev emission from AGN is believed to comes from the core of supermassive
blackholes in small regions in the core of distant galaxies.  AGN are
not expected to be spatially resolvable and therefore provide a good
calibration source to demonstrate the efficacy of our tool. Nevertheless,
it would be interesting if AGN could be spatially resolved and
there are theories that predict this (\cite{pair_halo_paper}).

Following 1FGL, the LAT collaboration published
a list of sources that had a high probability association with
AGN (\cite{first_agn_cat}).
1FGL had 709 AGN associated with 671 distinct
1FGL sources at high latitude ($|b|>10\deg$).  To avoid systematic
problems with AGN classification, we used only the 599 AGN which made
it into the clean AGN sample.  An AGN association is only considered
clean if it has a high probability of association $P\ge 80\%$, if it is
the only AGN associated with the 1FGL source, and if there are no flags
on the catalog source (\cite{first_cat}). These last two conditions are
especially important for our analysis.  Source confusion may look like
a spatially extended source and flagged catalog sources may correlate
with unmodeled structure in the diffuse emission.

Of the 599 ``clean'' AGN, we select 556 of these 1FGL sources which
we uniquely associate with a 2FGL source. We furthermore
restrict our select to the 515 of these AGN for which we fit $\ts>25$
using \pointlike and photons with energy above 1 \gev.  Our intention
here is not to find the largest sample of AGN but simply
to find a good sample to test the systematics of our extended source
search.

Using the same extension fitting procedure as described above, we tested
these 515 AGN for extension. A histogram of the \tsext values computed
with \pointlike is shown in figure~\ref{agn_ts_ext}. Overlaid on the plot
is a $\chi^2/2$ distribution suggested by Wilks' Theorem.  This plot
shows a worse agreement with the theoretical distribution and
a discrepancy with 
our Monte Carlo study in figure~\ref{ts_ext_mc}.  But overall, the
distribution is good. No AGN get fit with a particularly significant
value of $\tsext$ and almost all of the AGN get fit with $\tsext<1$.
There where only two AGN with $\tsext>10$. The maximum had $\tsext=13.7$
whereas the maximum value expected theoretically by the $\chi^2/2$ distribution is
8.3. This result shows that there is some systematic with our
analysis but that it will not significantly affect our analysis.
% 8.3 number gotten from mathematica:
% PDF[ChiSquareDistribution[1], x]
% N[Solve[(1/2)*
%     Integrate[1/(E^(x/2)*(Sqrt[2*Pi]*Sqrt[x])), {x, TS, Infinity}] &=&  
%        1/515, TS]]

Several possible systematics could cause this discrepancy. The first is
that in our analysis we fit each source with a power-law spectral model.
AGN tend to have curved spectral and fitting with the wrong spectral
model might effect the value of \tsext. Nevertheless, since we use only
photons with energy above 1 \gev, this effect is not expected to be large.
Another possible source for the discrepancy is that \pointlike performs
a likelihood analysis without modeling the energy dispersion of the LAT.
This probably is not the cause because energy dispersion is expected to
be more significant at low energy and it would have also showed up with
the Monte Carlo simulations.

Another possible systematic may be due to source confusion to problems
with the background model. If the two sources were close, they may
be unresolvable and get fit as a more significant extended source.
It is also possible that there are lingering residuals in the diffuse
emission. Unmodeled parts of the diffuse emission could be filled in by
modeling point sources as being slightly extended.

The final effect that could cause this discrepancy is an imperfect
modeling of the PSF.  Before launch, the PSF
was determined by a Monte Carlo simulation of the detector.
After launch, a discrepancy was found using flight data above a
few \gev in the PSF measured using bright AGN.  This result
was presented in conference and a publication is in preparation.
Subsequently, the PSF was fit empirically to bright AGN and this
empirical parameterization was used in the LAT's instrument
response function (\cite{lat_on_orbit_psf}).
But the current parameterization is not perfect. There are lingering
issues due to a lack of statistics at high energy which makes it hard to
validate the PSF as a function of the incident angle of the photon. Since
the distribution of incident angles varies from source to source, an
average PSF may make some of the sources look more and less extended
than the PSF.

We should finally clarify that since the PSF was found empirically
from the shape of bright AGN, finding that the AGN we test are not
significantly extended is not surprising.  All this analysis shows
is that the we can significantly find sources larger than bright AGN
found by the LAT.  Trying to look for the extension of these AGN as a
population would require a more specialized analysis.

Nine extended sources not include in 2FGL were found
using this search.  Three were found in our search using only photons
with energies above 1 \gev and six were found only using photones with
energies above 10 \gev.  The fit properties of these nine sources is
summarized in table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  The table includes for each
source the best fit position, extension, spectrum, source significance,
and significance of extension.  Figure~\ref{allsky_extended_sources}
shows a skymap of the position of the twelve sources included in 2FGL
and the nine sources analysis in this paper.

For the new extended sources, table~\ref{dual_localization_results}
presents a test for source confusion by fitting the region
as two point sources. The table compares \tsext
to \tsinc and summarizes the positions and spectra of the two sources.
Finally, table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} summarized the results of
a crosscheck of the source fitting the region with an alternative diffuse
model described in section~\ref{alt_diff_model_description}.  These tables
show that our extended sources are not likely the result of source confusion
and that they are robust to changing the diffuse emission model.

The two year catalog source 2FGL J0823.0-4246 was found to be
extended using photons with energy between 1 \gev and 100 \gev.
We found an extension of $0.37\deg\pm0.03\deg$ and an extension
significance of $\tsext=46.1$.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(260.32\deg,-3.28\deg)$.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248} shows a
counts map of this source.  This source is coincident with the one year
catalog source 1FGL J0823.3-4248.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL J0823.4-4305 and 2FGL J0821.0-4254 which are part of the
extended source.  We tested the source for source confusion by fitting
it as two point sources. Because $\tsinc=21.9$ is smaller then \tsext,
we conclude that this is an extended source.  
These modifications are shown in
figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248}.

This extended source is spatially coincident with the SNR Puppis A.

The two year catalog source 2FGL J1627.0-2425c was found to be
significantly extended when using photons with energies between 1 \gev
and 100 \gev.  The best fit extension was $0.53\deg\pm0.06\deg$ and the
best fit position is $(l,b)=(352.87\deg, 16.79\deg)$.
The extension significance was $\tsext=20.3$. 
This source is coincident with the one year catalog source 1FGL J1628.6-2419c.
A counts map showing this source is
seen in figure \ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c}.  To test for source confusion,
we also fit the source instead as two point sources. Since $\tsinc=19.3$
is smaller than \tsext, we conclude that this is an extended source.

This source is in a region of remarkably complicated diffuse emission.
Even though it is 16\deg from the Galactic plane, the source is on top
of the core of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud which contains massive
star-forming regions that are bright in the infrared.  We have overlaid
on figure~\ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c} contours of the 100 micrometer infared
image of this region measured by IRAS. There is good spatial overlap
with the \gev emission (\cite{iras_rho_ophiuci}).

The region also has abundant molecular and atomic gas traced by CO
and HI but also plenty of dark gas, the kind that we find only by its
association with dust emission. Embedded star-forming regions make it even
more challenging to measure the column density of dust.  Although this
region is significantly extended, we conclude that this source most
likely represents inadequacy in the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission model.

also spatially extended (see section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}).
To get a good fit of both sources, we had to model both sources as
being spatially extended and iteratively fit the position and extension
of each source until obtaining a global best fit.  Before doing this,
We removed from our model the source 2FGL J1614.9-5212 because it is
part of 2FGL J1615.2-5138's. Furthermore, we removed
the nearby catalog sources 2FGL J1619.7-5040c and 2FGL J1620.6-5111c
because they were not significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications
are further described in the caption to figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.
After modifying the region, we found that \tsinc=12.2 which is less than
\tsext so we conclude that the source is extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the extended \tev source HESS
J1616-508 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c},
contours of HESS J1616-508 are overlaid on 2FGL J1615.0-5051.
The H.E.S.S. experiment measured an extension $0.136\pm 0.008$
when fitting the source with an elliptical Gaussian spatial model.
This size corresponds to a 68\% source containment radius of
$\rsixeight\sim0.21\deg\pm0.01$. This size is comparable to the LAT size
$\rsixeight=0.27\deg\pm0.03$ (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of
2FGL J1615.0-5051 connects smoothly to the 
H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS J1616-508.

\label{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}

The two year catalog source 2FGL J1615.2-5138 was found to be
extended using photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev.
We found an extension of $0.42\deg\pm0.03\deg$ with an extension
significance of \tsext=47.6.  The source was fit to a position
of $(l,b)=(331.66\deg,-0.66\deg)$.  This source is coincident
with the one year catalog source 1FGL J1614.7-5138c.  Because 2FGL
J1615.2-5138 is close to 2FGL J1615.0-5051, the same model described
in section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.0-5051} was used to analyze both
sources. Both sources can be seen in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.
For 2FGL J1615.2-5138, \tsinc=37.6 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the extended \tev source HESS
J1614-518 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}). In figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c},
contours of HESS J1614-518 are overlaid on 2FGL J1615.2-5138.
The H.E.S.S. experiment measured a Gaussian extension of
$\sigma=0.23\deg\pm0.02\deg$ and $\sigma=0.15\pm0.02$ in the semi-major
and semi-minor axis. This size corresponds to a 68\% containment size
of $\rsixeight=0.35\pm0.03\deg$ and $0.23\pm0.03$.  This elliptical size
matches well the LAT size of $\rsixeight\sim0.34\pm0.02$.
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of
2FGL J1615.2-5138 connects smoothly to the 
H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS J1614-518.

The two year catalog source 2FGL J1632.4-4753c was found to be
extended using photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev.
We fit an extension of $0.44\deg\pm0.04\deg$ with an extension
significance of \tsext=64.8.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(336.41\deg,0.22\deg)$.  This source is coincident with the one
year catalog source 1FGL J1632.9-4802c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}
shows a counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove from our model
three catalog sources 2FGL J1631.7-4720c, 2FGL J1630.2-4752, 2FGL
J1634.4-4743c.4-4820c that were part of the extended source..
We then iterativly relocalized the source 2FGL J1635.4-4717c
to $(l,b)=(337.230\deg,0.346\deg)$ and 2FGL J1636.3-4740c to
$(l,b)=(336.968\deg,-0.066\deg)$ while fitting the extension of
2FGL J1632.4-4753c.  In addition we removed from our model four
farther away two year catalog sources 2FGL J1638.0-4703c, 2FGL
J1628.1-4857c, 2FGL  J1630.1-4615, 2FGL J1639.8-4921c because they
were not significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications are shown in
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}.

To test for source confusion, we compared the likelihood fitting this
region as one extended source to the likelihood fitting this region as
two point sources. We found $\tsinc=40.9\loglikelihood\tsext$ which is less than \tsext
so we conclude that this is an extended source.

This extended source is spatially coincident with the extended \tev source HESS
J1632-478 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c},
contours of  HESS J1632-478 are overlaid on 2FGL J1635.4-4717c.
H.E.S.S measured an extension of $\sigma=0.21\pm0.05$ and
$0.06\pm0.04$ along the semi-major and semi-minor axes when fitting the source
with an elliptical Gaussian spatial model.  This corresponds to a 68\%
containment size of $\rsixeight=0.31\pm0.08$ and $0.09\pm0.06$ along the
semi-major and semi-minor axis. This size is consistent with the LAT size of
$\rsixeight=0.36\pm0.03$.
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of
2FGL J1635.4-4717c connects smoothly to the 
H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS J1632-478.

The two year catalog source 2FGL J1837.3-0700c was found to be
extended using photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev.
We fit an extension of $0.35\deg\pm0.08\deg$ with an extension
significance of $\tsext=20.2$.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(25.08\deg,0.13\deg)$.  This source is coincident with the one
year catalog source 1FGL J1837.5-0659c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}
shows a counts map of this source.

This source is in a complicated region. There are three nearby catalog
sources 
2FGL J1834.7-0705c, 2FGL J1836.8-0623c, and 2FGL J1839.3-0558c.
To get a good fit of 2FGL J1837.3-0700c,
we relocalized 
2FGL J1834.7-0705c to $(l,b)=(24.77\deg,0.50\deg)$.  
2FGL J1836.8-0623c moved to $(l,b)=(25.57\deg,0.32\deg)$, and 
2FGL J1839.3-0558c to $(l,b)=(26.08\deg,0.23\deg)$.  
We removed the nearby catalog source 2FGL J1835.5-0649 which is part
of the extended source and the farther away catalog
source 2FGL J1839.0-0539 because it was not significant above 10 \gev.
After modifying the region, we found that \tsinc=12.3 which is less
than \tsext, so we conclude that the source is spatially extended. These
modifications are shown in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}.

This source is spatially coincident with the \tev source HESS J1837-069
(\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c},
contours of are H.E.S.S J1837-069 are overlaid on 2FGL
J1837.3-0700c. H.E.S.S. measured an extension of $\sigma=0.12\pm0.02$
and $0.05\pm0.02$ along the semi-major and semi-minor axis when fitting
the source with an elliptical Gaussian spatial model.  This corresponds to
a 68\% containment radius of $\rsixeight=0.18\pm0.03$ and $0.08\pm0.03$
along the semi-major and semi-minor axis. The size is comparable to
LAT which fit a 68\% containment radius of $\rsixeight=0.29\pm0.07$.
The LAT size is larger than the H.E.S.S. size but the sizes are almost
almost within the $1\sigma$ errors. It is possible that the morphologies
are different but this is not very significant.  A possible reason is
confusion could be that the LAT source may be partially fitting other
sources in the region.  Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT
spectrum of 2FGL J1837.3-0700c connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum
of HESS J1837-069.

The two year catalog source 2FGL J1712.4-3941 was found to be

a smoothed counts map of this source.

This source is spatially conincident with the SNR RX J1713.7-3946 and was
recently reported by (\cite{rx_j1713_lat}).  To analyze this source,
we used the same background model as the recent LAT publication.
2FGL J1715.4-4024c is spatially coincident with Source A and was

The two year catalog source 2FGL J2021.5+4026 was found to be extended
using photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. This source
is coincident with the one year catalog source 1FGL J2020.0+4049. We
fit an extension of $0.59\deg\pm0.03\deg$ with an extension
significance of $\tsext=139.4$.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(78.17\deg,2.19\deg)$.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049} shows a
counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
source 2FGL J2019.1+4040 which were part of the extended source.
Further, we found it necessary to add an additional point source not in
the two year catalog into our background model.  The new source is was
localized to a position of $(l,b)=(78.85,2.67)$ and had $\ts\approx 16$
(using \pointlike).  Although the source is not very significant, not
including it into the background model appeared visually to significantly
throw off the fit of the region.  In addition, we removed the four
further away catalog sources 2FGL J2022.8+3843c, 2FGL J2020.0+4159,
2FGL J2013.8+4115c, and 2FGL J2012.4+3955c from the region because they
were not significant above 10 \gev.  After modifying the region, we found
that \tsinc=29.7 which is less than \tsext, so we believe that this
source is spatially extended.  These modifications are further described
in the caption to figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049}.

This source is spatially coincident with the Gamma Cygni SNR.  Contours of
Gamma Cygni at 408MHz from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey are overlaid

\section{Conclusion}

\todo[inline]{This conclusion needs to be written.}

Many extended sources. Especially instructive to
use photons with energy above 10 \gev where we don't have
to worry about diffuse background as much.

Make some conclusion about how the LAT will eventually collect a factor
of five more data! Pointlike will be necessary to improve the model of the
high energy sky. Hard to do a blind analysis of LAT data.

Figure~\ref{allsky_extended_sources} is an all sky map showing the
location of all \gev extended sources. Note how most
extended sources are in the Galactic plane.

Figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_histogram} is a histogram comparing the size of
all extended sources seen in \gev by the LAT and in \tev by H.E.S.S..
Note how H.E.S.S. can see smaller sources whereas the LAT
can see bigger sources.

For all extended sources seen both in \gev and \tev,
figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_plot} shows a comparision of their sizes.
Note that there is pretty good agreement.

    The results of the Monte Carlo simulation described
    in section \ref{monte_carlo_validation} and detailed in
    table~\ref{ts_ext_num_sims}. The plot shows the null distribution of
    the likelihood ratio test when fitting a point source for extension.
    The $x$ axis is \tsext and the $y$ axis is the cumulative density
    for \tsext of simulated point sources. The four plots represent
    different spectral indices and the different colors represent
    different fluxes.  The dashed red line is the cumulative density
    function of $\chi^2(\ts)/2$ which is suggested by Wilks' theorem
    as the distribution these curves should should follow.  There is
    a surprisingly good agreement between the Monte Carlo results and
    the theoretical distribution. For most spectral parameters, the
    Monte Carlo curve lies to the left of the theoretical curve which
    would make the theoretical distribution more conservative.  In this
    paper, we use this theoretical curve to estimate the significance of
    our source detections. This plot cuts off three simulations of the
    source with flux $3\times10^{-8}\ph/\cm^2/\sec$ and spectral index
    2.5 which had \tsext of 26.1, 28.9, and 38.1.

    This plot shows the detection threshold to resolve an extended source.
    It is defined as the flux where $\langle\tsext\rangle=25$ for a
    given extension.  The $x$ axis is the extension of a uniform disk
    extended source and the $y$ axis is the source's 100 \mev to 100
    \gev photon flux.  All sources have an assumed power-law spectrum
    and the different colors are for sources of different simulated
    spectral indices.  The solid line is the detection threshold using
    photons with energy between 100 \mev and 100 \gev while the dashed
    line is the threshold using photons with energy between 1 \gev and
    100 \gev.  The detection threshold is for a one year simulation
    against a Sreekumar-like isotropic background.  More information
    about this plot is presented in section~\ref{extension_sensitivity}.
    This plot shows that our threshold to detecting the extension of
    a source is best for a source with size $~0.5\deg$. It also shows
    that for sources neither too large nor soft, our sensitivity is not
    significantly improved using photons with energy between 100 \mev
    and 1 \gev.

    against a Sreekumar-like isotropic background. The green dashed
    curve is the sensitivity against 10 times the isotropic background
    and the solid red curve is the sensitivity against 100 times the
    isotropic background.  The latter factor approximately represents
    the intensity of the Galactic diffuse emission near the Galactic
    center.  The left plot is the sensitivity using photons with energies
    between 1 \gev and 100 \gev while the right plot is the sensitivity
    using photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. Unlike
    figure~\ref{index_sensitivity}, the sensitivity was calculated
    only for a power-law source of spectral index 2. The flux is quoted
    only in the selected energy range which weakens the dependence of
    the detection threshold on spectral index.  These plots show that
    we are less sensitive to extended sources in regions with higher
    background and (given the same number of photons) more sensitive
    to harder sources.  More information about this plot is presented

      \caption{For the new extended source candidates
      in table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}, we describe the
      results of the dual localization procedure described in
      section~\ref{dual_localization_method}. Here, the extended
      source candidate is not fit as an extended source but instead
      fit as two point sources.  The dual localization is performed
      with \pointlike and results in the best fit position of the two
      sources $(\glon_1,\glat_1)$ and $(\glon_2,\glat_2)$.  The change
      in likelihood and spectral values are then computed using \gtlike
      with the best fit positions found by \pointlike.  \tsinc is the
      increase in TS fitting the region as two sources compared to
      fitting compared to fitting a single point source and is computed
      using \gtlike with the best fit positions taken from \pointlike.
      It can be directly compared to \tsext, which is taken from
      table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  For all of our candidates, $\tsext
      > \tsinc$ which shows that an extended source fits the source better
      than two point sources.  As in table~\ref{known_extended_sources},
      flux is measured in units of $10^{-9}\ph/\cm^2/\sec$ and is the
      integral flux between 1 \gev (10 \gev) and 100 \gev for the sources
      found using photons above 1 \gev (10 \gev).}

    The \tev extension of IC443 is from Veritas (\cite{ic443_veritas})

    The LAT extension of Vela X is from (\cite{velax}).  Except for RX
    J1713.7-3946 Vela Jr., the \tev sources were fit with a Gaussian
    spatial model so the plotted \gev and \tev extensions were first
    converted to \rsixeight (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
    Because of their large size, the RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr.
    were not directly fit in \tev and do not have errors associated with
    their measurements. The \tev radius of RX J1713.7-3946 is taken to
    be 0.5\deg and Vela Jr. is taken to be 1\deg. For these two sources,
    the LAT size is not converted to \rsixeight but the disk extension
    is directly compared.  This plot shows that there is good correlation
    between the \gev and \tev sizes of sources.

    Centarus A lobes, which have an extension $~10\deg$, are not
    included in the plot (\cite{cen_a_lat}).  The \tev extension of
    the 42 extended H.E.S.S. sources comes from the H.E.S.S. Source
    Catalog (\cite{hesscat}).  Except for RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr.,

    so the LAT and H.E.S.S. sizes are first converted to \rsixeight.

    morphology of RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr. is poorly matched by a
    gaussian, the \tev sizes are assuming a uniform disk spatial model
    and so neither the \gev nor \tev sizes were converted.  This plot
