We present a new method for analyzing 
the spatial extension of sources with
the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the
{\em Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}. 
The source extension is an important input to correctly 
associate LAT sources with their counterparts at other
wavelengths. We provide
a series of Monte Carlo studies to validate this tool and calculate
the LAT's detection threshold to spatially extended sources.  We then
apply this tool to test all sources in the two year source catalog for
extension. We present on the detection of nine spatially extended sources
in addition to the twelve spatially extended sources reported in the
second Fermi-LAT Catalog (2FGL).

\section{Introduction}

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair conversion telescope on the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (FGST). It has been surveying the $\gamma$-ray
sky since June 2008.  Fermi has a broad energy coverage (20 \mev to $>300$
\gev), wide field of view ($\approx 2.4 \sr$), and large effective area
($\approx 8000 \cm^2$ at $>1 \gev$).

Using two years of all sky surveying data, the LAT Collaboration
published a catalog of 1873 \gev sources\cite{second_cat}. Many of these can
be positionally associated with a variety of source classes including
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), pulsars, galaxies, and supernova
remnants (SNRs).  While many of the LAT sources can be
spatially
resolved when observed at other frequencies, detection of 
an extension at
\gev energies by the LAT is complicated by the rather large
point-spread function (PSF) of the instrument. The angular resolution
for events converting in the front part of the detector, defined as
the 68\% containment radius for a point source, is approximately
$3.5^{\circ}$ at 100 \mev, improving to about 0.1$^{\circ}$ at 10 \gev.

However, a number of sources positionally coincident
with LAT sources exhibit extensiosn at other
wavelengths which are larger or comparable to the LAT PSF.
In particular certain SNRs, pulsar wind
nebulae (PWNe), molecular clouds, normal galaxies, 
galaxy clusters or dark
matter satellites can therefore be expected
to be observed as spatially extended sources in the LAT.
The LAT collaboration has previously reported on
the discovered of five spatially extended supernova remnants, IC443,
W28, W44, W51C, and RX J1713.7-3946
(\cite{ic443,w28,w44,w51c,rx_j1713_lat}). In addition, three extended
PWNe were detected: MSH 15-52, Vela~X, and
HESS\,J1825-137 (\cite{msh1552,velax,fermi_hess_j1825}), as well as
two close-by galaxies, the Large Magellanic and Small Magalenic Cloud
(\cite{lmc,smc}), and finally the radio galaxy Centarus A
(\cite{cen_a_lat}) .

For each of these sources, the extension was determined based on
dedicated analysis of the particular source or region of interest
instead of being the outcome of a systematic search of the LAT catalog.
For the systematic scan of all LAT catalog sources presented here, we
therefore expect to find additional spatially extended LAT sources, in
particular since many extended sources in the Galactic plane have been
detected at \tev energies using Air Cherenkov detectors and \tev and
\gev emission often originates from the same population of high-energy
particles.  A variety of spatially extended sources have been detected
in the Galactic plane at \tev energies. Most prominent was a survey of
the Galactic plane using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S)
which presented 14 spatially extended sources
 with extensions varying from
$~0.1\deg$ to $~0.25\deg$ (\cite{hess_plane_survey}). In fact, within
our Galaxy only very few sources (most notably the $\gamma$-ray binaries
LS\,5039 (\cite{HESSLS5039}), LS I+61-303 (\cite{MAGICLSI, VERITASLSI})
and HESS\,J0632+057 (\cite{HESS0632}) are amongst the few Galactic sources
for which no significant extension was detected at \tev energies. Given
these findings, it can be expected that if the source population at \gev
energies has similar properties, that at least some of the Fermi-LAT
sources in our Galaxy should be spatially resolvable at \gev energies.

Being able to spatially resolve the \gev emission from a source is
important for several reasons. Because of the large PSF and the large
candidate source density in our Galaxy, source confusion is a severe
problem for the identification of LAT sources.  Finding a coherent
source extension across different energy bands allows a firm association
of a LAT source to an otherwise confused counterpart.  Because of the
strongly varying PSF of the LAT, the spatial and spectral information
about a source do not simply decouple. A biased spatial model will bias
the spectral model of the source. In particular, performing a spectral
analysis on a spatially extended source modeled as point-like will
systematically shift the spectral index to be softer.  Furthermore,
correctly modeling a source's extension is important for improving
the model of the sky and removing excess residuals, for example in the
region around surrounding the Large Magellanic Cloud (\cite{first_cat}).
Additionally, such excess residuals potentially bias the significance
and measured spectrum of neighboring sources in the densely populated
Galactic plane.

\section{Analysis Methods}

Morphological studies of sources in the \gev energy range using the
LAT are challenging because of the significantly energy-dependent PSF.
Additional complications arise close to the Galactic plane due to
systematic uncertainties in the Galactic diffuse emission.  The LAT's
PSF is limited at lower energies by multiple scattering in the tracker
and the 68\% containment radius of the PSF is approximately 5.1\deg
at 100 \mev  when averaged over instrument acceptance and including
photons which convert in either the thick or thin layers of the
tracker. The PSF improves with energy and approaches a limit given
by the granularity of the silicon strips and is 0.14\deg at 10 \gev
(\cite{on_orbit_calibration}).  The high resolution of the higher
energy photons in the LAT energy range however is offset by their low
statistics. Therefore a detailed investigation has been performed in this
work to determine the optimal energy range to measure source extension
(see below).

\subsection{The \pointlike Package}

A new analysis tool has been developed to address the unique requirements
for studying spatially extended sources with the LAT. The tool
provides a maximum likelihood analysis where the Poisson likelihood
for observing the measured counts is maximized,
given a parametrized spatial and spectral model of 
the source and its surrounding region.
The extension of a source can be modeled by a
geometric shape (e.g. a disk or Gaussian) and the source's position,
extension, and spectrum can be simultaneously fit.

This analysis is not feasible using the official LAT likelihood
analysis tool \gtlike\footnote{\gtlike is distributed publicly by the
Fermi Science Support Center (\cite{fssc})} because \gtlike can only 
fit the spectral parameters of the model. The extension fitting would
have to be done as an external loop which would typically be
too time consuming. What has typically
been done to study an extended sources is to fix the position of the
source and develop a profile of the likelihood as a
function of extension.  This approach is not optimal because the
position and extension of the source should be simultaneously maximized
to find the best fit parameters and to correctly compute the statistical
significance of the detection.  Furthermore since this approach is
computationally intensive, no large-scale Monte Carlo effort can
be run to validate it.

We developed an alternative approach to fit spatially extended
sources. A separate maximum likelihood fitting package called
\pointlike has been developed by the LAT collaboration and we have
added to it the ability to analyze spatially extended sources. \pointlike
is described in 1FGL and in Matthew Kerr's Ph.D thesis
(\cite{first_cat,matthew_kerr_thesis}).  

What differentiates \pointlike most significantly from \gtlike is its
emphasis on speed by introducing approximations into the calculation
of the likelihood function while trying to minimized the introduced
numerical errors.  Like the binned version of \gtlike, \pointlike bins
the sky in both position and energy.  Unlike \gtlike, \pointlike relies on
the {\em healpix} representation of spatial bins (\cite{healpix}). Since
the PSF changes significantly with energy, the spatial size of each bin
is chosen to be smaller than the PSF. By changing the spatial
bin size with energy, \pointlike ensures that little information is lost
at each energy while minimizing the required number of bins.

\pointlike also bins $\gamma$-rays depending upon whether they convert
in the thin or thick layers of the tracker. Since the PSF is smaller for
photons which convert in the thin layers of the tracker,
photons are also binned depending upon where they 
convert in the tracker.
Furthermore, \pointlike
uses a sparse matrix representation of the spatial bins where only the
bins with counts in them are used. To evaluate the likelihood, \pointlike
then independently integrates the model predicted counts in the region.

Intelligent binning and a sparse matrix representation of the data
effectively interpolates between a binned analysis at low energy (where
the resolution is poor and there are many counts) and an unbinned
analysis at high energy (where the resolution is good but there are
few counts). This approach provides significant savings in time while
introducing only small numerical error.

\subsection{Extension Fitting}
\label{extension_fitting}

In \pointlike, it is assumed that the spatial and spectral model
of an extended source decouple and that the spatial shape can be
represented by a two dimensional function.  To fit the extended source,
\pointlike convolves the extended source shape with the PSF (as a
function of energy) and uses the \minuit fitting library to maximize
the likelihood by simultaneously fitting the position and extension
of the source (\cite{minuit_documentation}).  As will be described in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}, simultaneously fitting the position
and extension is necessary to correctly calculate the statistical
significance of the detection of extension.  For each position and
extension, the spectral parameters of the sky model are refit. To avoid
projection effects, what is directly fit is not the longitude and latitude
but instead the source's displacement in a rotated reference frame.

The significance of the extension of a source can be calculated from
\tsext, which is defined as twice the increase in log likelihood (\loglikelihood)
between
the extended source model at its best fit values and the point source
model at its best fit values:
\begin{equation}
  \tsext=2\log(\loglikelihood_\text{ext}/\loglikelihood_\text{ps}).
\end{equation}
\pointlike calculates \tsext by fitting a source first with a spatially
extended model and then as a point source.  The interpretation
of \tsext in terms of a statistical significance is discussed in
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}.

The convolution of radially symmetric extended sources is optimized by
using a semi-analytic calculation.  The observed photon distribution
can be written as the convolution of the source shape ($I_\text{src}$)
with the PSF
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(\vec r) = \int  \text{PSF}(|\vec r - \vec r'|)I_\text{src}(\vec r') d A'.
\end{equation}
For the LAT, the PSF is parameterized by a {\em King function}
\begin{equation}
  \text{PSF}(\vec r) = 
  \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}
  \left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left(1+\frac{u}{\gamma}\right)^{-\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ are free parameters
(\cite{matthew_kerr_thesis}).  For radially symmetric extended sources,
the angular part of the integral can be done analytically
\begin{equation}
  \text{PDF}(u)= \int_0^\infty dv
  I_\text{src}(v) 
  \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)
  \left( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma + u + v}\right)^\gamma 
  \times ~_2F_1 \left(\gamma/2,\frac{1+\gamma}{2},1,\frac{4uv}{(\gamma+u+v)^2}\right).
\end{equation}
This convolution formula is used by \pointlike because it is faster
and more closely reduces to the PSF when the source's size is 
small.

There will always be a small numerical discrepancy between the PSF and
a very small extended source due to numerical error in the convolution.
In most situations, this error would be insignificant. But when testing
a source for extension, this offset can significantly bias the estimate
of the significance of the extension of a source.  To correct for this,
when testing a source for extension we compare the likelihood fitting
the source with an extended shape to the likelihood fitting it with its
extension fixed to ${10^{-10}}\deg$.

\subsection{Extension Errors}
\label{extension_error}

Errors on fit parameters are typically calculated in one of two
ways. The first method requires explicitly varying a parameter
while simultaneously optimizing the other parameters
until the log of the likelihood has fallen by a particular value.
The \minuit fitting
package provides the {\em Simplex} function to calculate errors this way
(\cite{minuit_documentation}).  The second method involves estimating the
likelihood function as being a multivariate Gaussian and calculating the
curvature of the log of the likelihood at the peak to estimate when the
function will decrease by the desired value. \minuit provides the {\em HESSE}
algorithm to calculate errors this way.  {\em HESSE} errors 
can be calculated significantly faster.

We found that the {\em HESSE} errors on the extension of a source
were sometimes badly estimated.  On the other hand, the {\em Simplex}
algorithm was prohibitively slow and would often fail to convergence. Our
approach to calculating extension errors is to fix the position of the
source and varying just the extension using the {\em Simplex} algorithm.
This approach makes the approximation that the covariance between each
spatial parameter is small but not that the likelihood is Gaussian. This
method is shown schematically in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(a) which
shows the change in \loglikelihood when varying the extension of the
SNR IC443.  The localization error is separately calculated by fixing
the extension and spectrum of the source and fitting a parabola to the
likelihood as a function of position.

\subsection{\gtlike Crosscheck}
\label{gtlike_crosscheck}

\pointlike is important for LAT analysis that require many iterations
such as source localization and extension fitting.  On the other hand,
because of the fewer approximations used in calculating the likelihood
we expect that the spectral parameters fit by \gtlike to be slightly
more precise.  Furthermore, because \gtlike is the standard likelihood
analysis package, it has been more extensively validated for spectral
analysis.  For that reason, in the following analysis  we use \pointlike
to determinate the position and extension of a source and then determine
the spectrum using \gtlike. Both \gtlike and \pointlike can estimate
the statistical significance of the extension of a source and we require
that both methods agree to claim a detection.

We found good agreement between the two methods. For the new extended
source candidates, table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} will shows a
comparison of \ts and \tsext computed using \pointlike and \gtlike.
Unless explicitly mentioned, all \ts, \tsext, and spectral parameters
were calculated using \gtlike using \pointlike's positions and extensions.

\subsection{Dual Localization}
\label{dual_localization_method}

There is a degeneracy between a spatially extended source and multiple
point sources.  To assess the possibility of source confusion,
we developed a function in \pointlike to simultaneously fit the position
of two point sources.  To improve the robustness of the fit, the sum and
difference of the positions of the two sources are fit in a coordinates
rotated to the equator.  The \loglikelihood is then maximized by fitting
the sum and difference of the positions.

We define \tsinc as twice the increase in \loglikelihood fitting the
region as two point sources compared to fitting the region as one point
source: \begin{equation}
  \tsinc=2\times(\loglikelihood_\text{2pts}-\loglikelihood_\text{ps}).
\end{equation} \tsinc can not be directly compared to \tsext to see
which model is more significant because the models are not nested
(\cite{statistics_with_care}). Even though the comparison of \tsext
with \tsinc is not a calibrated test, we find the extreme cases $\tsinc
\loglikelihood \tsext$ or $\tsinc\gg\tsext$ to be suggestive and we only
consider a source to be extended if $\tsext>\tsinc$.

Like extended sources described in section~\ref{gtlike_crosscheck},
the spectrum of the two point sources can be refit using \gtlike.
we quote the spectral values obtained from \gtlike using the best fit
positions found using \pointlike.  For the extended candidates found
by our search, we computed both \tsext and \tsinc.  The results will be
presented in table~\ref{dual_localization_results}.

\subsection{Comparing Source Sizes}

\label{compare_source_size}

The spatial shape of extended sources can be modeled
as a two dimensional Gaussian
\begin{equation}\label{gauss_pdf}
  \text{PDF}(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}\exp\left(-(x^2+y^2)/2\sigma^2\right)
\end{equation}
or a uniform disk
\begin{equation}\label{disk_pdf}
  \text{PDF}(x,y)=\tfrac{1}{\pi\sigma^2}\delta\left(x^2+y^2<\sigma^2\right).
\end{equation}
Although these shapes are significantly different, the convolution of them
with the PSF look similar.  Figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss} demonstrates
this by showing the PSF, PDF, and convolution of the PDF with the PSF
for a uniform disk and Gaussian spatial model of size 0.5\deg.  This plot
shows that we are not very sensitive to probing the exact structure of an
extended source.  In the following we assume a uniform disk spatial model.

To get the convolved shapes to match in figure~\ref{compare_disk_gauss},
we had to set them to predict the same 68\% containment
radius of 0.5\deg.  The 68\% containment radius for a
spatial model is the radius at which 68\% of the intensity is
enclosed.  It can be computed by a straightforward integral
and we find that $\rsixeight_\text{,Gaussian}=1.51\sigma$
whereas $\rsixeight_\text{,disk}=0.82\sigma$ where $\sigma$
is defined in equation~\ref{disk_pdf} for the Gaussian source and
equation~\ref{gauss_pdf} for the disk source.  Since $\rsixeight=0.5\deg$,
the uniform disk has $\sigma=0.41\deg$ and the Gaussian has
$\sigma=0.75\deg$.

This is important when comparing morphologies to other wavelengths
because the quoted size can vary significantly depending on which quantity
is reported.  This effect can be best seen in figure~\ref{compare_r68}
which a counts map of an extended source simulated in the energy
range from 1 \gev to 100 \gev with a uniform disk spatial model with
an extension $\sigma$ of 0.5. Overlaid on the plot is the fit extension
assuming the source has a uniform disk and a Gaussian spatial model. The
plot overlays both $\sigma$ and $\rsixeight$ and $\sigma$ is significantly
larger for the disk spatial hypothesis compared to the Gaussian spatial
model. On the other hand, the disk and Gaussian's 68\% containment radius
are similar.

Since we are not very sensitive to the particular morphology of an
extended source, there is no correct choice for which size to quote
or which shape to overlay. For the following analysis, we quote the
disk's edge and overlay this size.  But due to smearing of the PSF,
$\sigma$ typically looks larger than the observed counts distribution.
When comparing the fit extensions with other wavelengths, it is important
to compare consistent quantities.


\section{LAT Extended Source Validation}


\subsection{Significance of Extension}
\label{monte_carlo_validation}

We validated \pointlike's extension fitting code with a Monte Carlo
study. \tsext (defined in section~\ref{extension_fitting}) can be used to calculate the statistical significance
of the extension of a source.  Since the point source and extended source models are
nested, an extended source must always fit as well as a point source.  On the other hand, we would
not expect the likelihood to change very much unless the source was
significantly extended.  Since an extended source has one additional
degree of freedom, Wilks' Theorem predicts that the distribution of $\tsext$
when testing a point source for extension should follow a $\chi^2_1$
distribution (\cite{wilks_theorem}).

However, since the null hypothesis rests on the edge of
parameter space when the extension is 0, Wilks' Theorem does not hold
(\cite{warn_wilks_theorem}).  One might expect the actual distribution
to be a half $\chi^2_1$ distribution with one degree of freedom plus
half a delta function at 0:
\begin{equation}
  P(\ts)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\chi^2_1(\ts)+\delta(\ts)).
\end{equation}
Chernoff proved that under certain assumptions this is the correct distribution
when the null hypothesis is on the edge of parameter
space (\cite{chernoff}).  The false detection
probability can be estimated by integrating this function from an observed
test statistic value to infinity. It is for this particular distribution
that the often quoted result holds that $\sqrt{\ts}$ is a measure of
the number of $\sigma$ of the detection (\cite{mattox_egret}).

The half $\chi^2_1$ distribution was found to hold for the special case
of source finding using EGRET (\cite{mattox_egret}). This distribution
is also plausible when testing point sources for extension. Due to
statistical fluctuations, half of the point sources might look narrower
than the PSF leading to $\tsext=0$. The other half of the time, we would
get a distribution consistent with Wilks' theorem. We will present a
Monte Carlo study that shows an empirical distribution of \tsext in the
null hypothesis and compares it to this distribution.

We simulated point sources of varying spectral models and fit them
them using \pointlike as both point and extended sources. The data was
simulated using \gtobssim\footnote{\gtobssim is distributed
by the Fermi Science Support Center (\cite{fssc}).}
The point sources were simulated with a power-law spectral model with
six $>100$ \mev fluxes ranging from $3\times 10^{-9} \ph/\cm^2/\sec$ to
$10^{-6} \ph/\cm^2/\sec$.  The point sources were simulated with spectral
indices ($\gamma$) of 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3.  These values were picked to
to represent typical source parameters in LAT-detected sources. The point
sources were simulated on top of an isotropic power-law background
with a Sreekumar-like spectrum ($>100$ \mev flux of $1.5\times 10^{-5}$ and spectral
index 2.1) (\cite{sreekumar_isotropic}).  The Monte Carlo simulation was
performed over a one year time interval using a default rocking profile
and a representative livetime fraction of 0.8.  The reconstruction was
performed with photons from an energy range of 1 \gev to 100 \gev using 4
energy bins per decade and using the 
Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6) Source Instrument
Response Function (IRFs).  For each point source, we used \pointlike
to fit it as both a point and extended source and calculate \tsext and
we only kept the sources which had a significant point source detection
($\ts>25$).


For most of the spectral models, ~30,000 statistically independent
simulations were performed. For the dimmer spectral models, many of the
simulations had $\ts<25$ and were discarded.  Table~\ref{ts_ext_num_sims}
shows the different spectral models used in our study as well as the
number of simulations.  The cumulative density of \tsext is plotted in
figure~\ref{ts_ext_mc}. The $\chi^2_1/2$ distribution suggested by Wilks'
Theorem is overlaid for comparison.

Our Monte Carlo study shows broad agreement between simulations and Wilks'
theorem. Nevertheless, the agreement is not perfect.  It should be noted
that the discrepancy seems to be worst for bright sources which seems to
imply that numerical errors in the convolution become more apparent for
sufficiently bright sources.  Other possible reasons for departure from
Wilks' theorem might include \pointlike ignoring energy dispersion which
would change the PSF's shape as a function of energy. But we emphasize
that most of the time, our empirical curve lies to the left of the
theoretical curve so using the theoretical distribution would lead to an
underestimate of the statistical significance of a detection. Therefore,
we are confident that $\sqrt{\tsext}$ can be used as a measure of the
statistical significance of a source's extension and use it in the
following analysis.

\section{Extended Source Detection Threshold}\label{extension_sensitivity}

We calculated the LAT's detection threshold to spatially
extended sources. The detection threshold to extension is
defined as the flux at which the average value of $\tsext$ is
$\langle\tsext\rangle=16$ corresponding to a $4\sigma$ detection (see
section~\ref{monte_carlo_validation}).  Qualitatively, we expect the LAT
would not be sensitive to sources much smaller than the PSF or much larger
than the PSF.  Small sources would look too much like the PSF and larger
sources would get lost in the background due to low surface brightness.

To calculate the LAT's detection threshold, we simulated sources with
a uniform radially symmetric disk spatial model on top of a power-law
Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum (\cite{sreekumar_isotropic}).  The Monte
Carlo simulation was performed using the same two year time range that
was used in 2FGL.  For each extension and spectral index, we picked a
flux range which bracketed $\tsext=16$. We then picked ten flux points in
this range and repeatedly simulated and then performed extension tests of
the simulated extended source.  We calculated $\langle\tsext\rangle=16$
by fitting a line to the flux and $\tsext$ values.

Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows the threshold for sources of four
spectral indices from 1.5 to 3 and extension varying from $\sigma=0.1\deg$
to $2.0\deg$.  The LAT's threshold to extension
is better for harder sources with more high energy photons and
the threshold is best for sources with an extension 
$\approx0.5\deg$ and is significantly worse for very small extended small.
Figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} shows the threshold using photons with
energies between 100 \mev and 100 \gev and also using only photons
with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev.  Except for the hardest
and largest sources, our detection threshold is almost unchanged when
including photons with energies between 100 \mev and 1 \gev.  This is also
demonstrated in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(b) which shows \tsext for the
SNR IC443 computed independently in twelve energy bins between 100 \mev and
100 \gev. For IC443, which has a spectral index $\approx2.4$, almost the entire
increase in \ts comes from energies above 1 \gev.  On the other hand,
other systematic errors become increasingly important at low energy. For
our extension search, we use only only photons with energy above 1 \gev.

Figure~\ref{diff_factor_sensitivity} shows how the LAT's detection
threshold increases with increasing background. We compute the threshold
using 1, 10, and 100 times the Sreekumar-like isotropic background. The
latter factor approximately represents the intensity of the Galactic
diffuse emission near the Galactic center.  The figure shows the threshold
using only photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev and aldo
when using only photons with energies between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. We
are less sensitive to extended sources with higher background. Also,
given the same flux we are more sensitive to the source if those
photons have a higher energies.

Overlaid on figure~\ref{diff_factor_sensitivity} are the LAT
detected extended sources from table~\ref{known_extended_sources} and
table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  The extended sources are color coded
based upon whether the galactic diffuse and isotropic emission model is
closer to 1, 10, or 100 times the Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum.

Finally, figure~\ref{all_sensitivity} shows the LAT's detection threshold
for all four spectral indices (1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3) against all three
background levels (1, 10, and 100 times the Sreekumar-like isotropic
background).  For a fixed 1 \gev to 100 \gev or 10 \gev to 100 \gev
flux, the LAT's detection threshold is only weakly depends upon the
spectral index.  This effect is most pronounced when using only photons
with energies above 10 \gev. The extension thresholds are tabulated in
table~\ref{all_sensitivity_table}.

\section{Extended Source Search Method}

2FGL is a list of 1873 \gev sources detected by the LAT.  2FGL included
twelve previously published spatially extended sources but did not
attempt to fit the extension of these sources. Other than these sources,
all 2FGL sources were modeled as point sources and 2FGL did not attempt to
resolve the extension of new sources.  In this paper, we tested all 2FGL
sources for extension to search for new spatially extended \gev sources.

For this search, we build a model of the
sky consistent with 2FGL.   We used the same two
years of data from August 4, 2008 to August 1, 2010 and we used the same
Pass 7\_V6 (P7\_V6) Source class event selections and 
Instrument Response Functions (IRFs, \cite{lat_on_orbit_psf}).  We used the same Galactic diffuse,
isotropic diffuse, and earth limb emission model. The spectrum of the
Galactic and isotropic diffuse models were refit during the analysis
while the earth limb emission was fixed to it's predicted value.

As was shown, we gain little in sensitivity using photons with energies
below 1 \gev. On the other hand, the large PSF at low energy makes us
more susceptible to systematic errors arising from source confusion due
to multiple point sources and susceptible to incorrect modeling of the
Galactic diffuse emission. In addition, the Galactic diffuse emission
is more pronounced at lower energies due to its steep energy spectrum.
For that reason, we performed our search using photons only between 1
\gev and 100 \gev.  We used 4 energy bins per each logarithmic decade
in energy.

We also performed a search for extended sources using photons only
between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. Even though we are testing the same
sources, this approach is complimentary because the Galactic diffuse
emission is even less dominant above 10 \gev. Furthermore, source
confusion becomes less of a problem since most LAT sources are not
significant at energies above 10 \gev.  Using higher energies, we might
expect to detect harder sources in more complicated regions. This is
beneficial for regions near pulsars which cutoff before 10 \gev and was
successfully used in detecting HESS\,J1825-137 and MSH 15-52 with the LAT
(\cite{msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}).

For each catalog source, we tested it for extension using \pointlike
assuming the source had a uniform radially symmetric disk spatial model.
We used a circular $10\deg$ region of interest centered on our source and
included all catalog sources within $15\deg$ of the source of interest.
We refit the spectral parameters of sources within $2\deg$ of the source.
We modeled each source with a power-law spectral model. This was reasonable because for a source to be significantly
extended, it would have to be fairly hard and fit reasonably well by
a power-law. Second, since we began the analysis at either 1 \gev or
10 \gev, we didn't expect there to be significant curvature over this
energy range.

Finally, when analyzing the region, we automatically removed other
2FGL sources which were within 0.5\deg of the source of interest. This was done because of
a concern that extended sources would end up 2FGL as
multiple point sources. These spurious sources would then
distort the extension fit.
For each extended candidate, we performed a dual localization procedure
(described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method} to test if the
source is extended. We select the sources where $\tsext>16$.

\subsection{Additional Analysis}

Since extragalactic sources are typically too far away to be resolvable,
we expect most extended sources to be inside our Galaxy and most
likely on the Galactic plane.  Unfortunately, the \gev emission
in the Galactic plane is dominated by extremely structured Galactic
diffuse emission.  Finding sources on top of this emission is difficult
(\cite{first_diffuse_paper}) as has been discussed in 1FGL and 2FGL
(\cite{first_cat,second_cat}).  Furthermore, the Galactic plane is crowded
and it is often difficult to correctly model nearby sources.  Because of this,
finding a source with $\tsext>16$ is not a sufficient
criteria for resolving a source. For each extended source,
we perform several analysis crosschecks.

% 2FGL J1856.2+0450c = P72Y3047 for
As an example of why this is important, we describe the test of 
2FGL\,J1856.2+0450c for extension.  Figure~\ref{example_bad_fit} shows
a Galactic and isotropic diffuse emission subtracted
smoothed counts map of this source using photons with energy 
between 1 \gev and 100 \gev. 
In this region along the Galactic plane, there appears to be 
large-scale residual in the diffuse emission. As a result, 2FGL\,J1856.2+0450c 
fit to an extension of 1.83\deg and the result is statistically significant
with \tsext=45.4.  By looking at the residuals, it is clear that this
complicated region is not fit well even though the source's extension is
statistically significant. For this reason, we manually discard
the extension of this and similar sources.

For each extended source candidate,
we took the spatial and spectral model found using \pointlike and
performed a crosscheck by refitting the spectral parameters using
\gtlike.  We used a square ROI $14.1\deg$ in diameter with $1/32\deg$
spatial bins and the same energy binning as \pointlike. Using \gtlike,
we found a second measure of \tsext, this time not fitting the extension
but using a fixed template with the extension determined by \pointlike.
We only considered a source to be significantly extended if \pointlike
and \gtlike both agreed.  For the new extended source candidates,
table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} will show a comparison of of \tsext for
\gtlike and \pointlike.

For each candidate, we generated a map of residual \ts
by adding a new source of spectral index 2 into the region and finding
the increase in likelihood when fitting its flux. \ts maps are useful
to look for residual structure in the sky mode.  Figure~\ref{res_tsmaps}
shows a residual \ts map for the extended source IC443.

For each candidate, we generated plots of the sum of all counts
within a given distance of the source and compared it to the model
predictions of a point source.  The plots were binned uniformly
in $\Delta \theta^2$ so that an isotropic background would be flat.
An example radial integral plot is shown for the extended source IC443
in figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(c).  For each source, we also made
Galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission subtracted smoothed counts
maps. Figure~\ref{four_plots_ic443}(d) shows an example for IC443. 

For each source, we tested to see if the region contained instead
multiple point sources by replacing the extended source with
two point sources and performed the dual localization procedure
described in section~\ref{dual_localization_method}.  We only
considered a source to be extended if $\tsext>\tsinc$.  For the new
extended sources, we will show the results of this dual localization in
table~\ref{dual_localization_results}.

Because of the high source density in the Galactic plane, for promising
candidates we often had to iteratively improve the model of our background
sources to obtain a better fit of the sources.  Often, several catalog
sources would fill in the emission of the extended source and would
have to be removed from the region.  Similarly, background sources
were often insignificant in the fit energy range and had to be removed.
The position of background sources would often have to be refit once the
extended source was fit.  When the model of the extended source coupled
strongly with nearby sources, we iteratively fit the extended source and
all nearby sources until the fit converged.  For each extended source,
we describe the modification that were required.

\subsection{Systematic Errors on Extension}
\label{systematic_errors_on_extension}

% Alternative PSF

We estimate a systematic error on the extension of a source due to
uncertainty in our knowledge of the angular resolution of the LAT.  Before
launch, the LAT PSF was determined by a detector simulation which was
verified in accelerator tests (\cite{atwood_LAT_mission}).  A discrepancy
was found in flight data above a few \gev in the PSF compared to the
shape of bright AGN.  A publication on this issue is in preparation
(\cite{lat_on_orbit_psf}).  Subsequently, the PSF was fit empirically to
bright AGN and this empirical parameterization is the default PSF used
in the P7\_V6 IRFs.  To account for this uncertainty in our knowledge of
the PSF, we refit our extended source candidates using the Monte Carlo
representation of the PSF and consider the difference in extension found
using the two PSFs as a systematic error on the extension of a source.
Because the Monte Carlo representation of the PSF is smaller, it leads
to unphysically higher \tsext values.  This same approach was used in
(\cite{ic443}).  At high energies, we believe that our parameterization
of the PSF from bright AGN is substantially better than the Monte Carlo
representation of the PSF so this systematic errors is conservative.

% Alternate Diffuse

We estimate a second systematic error on the extension of a source
due to uncertainty in the model of the Galactic diffuse emission by
using an alternative diffuse model. The alternative model was based on
the GALPROP\footnote{GALPROP is a software package for calculating the
Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission based on a model of cosmic-ray propagation
in the Galaxy. See \url{http://galprop.stanford.edu/} for details and
references} model used in the LAT analysis of the isotropic diffuse
emission (\cite{isotropic_lat}).  With this model, we independently fit
along with the point and diffuse sources in the region seven HI rings,
seven HII rings, the inverse component, the E(B-V) residual, and the
isotropic component of the background emission.  All told, we fit in
the region 18 diffuse templates.  This same crosscheck was used in the
LAT Collaboration's analysis of RX J1713.7-3946 (\cite{rx_j1713_lat}).

It is not expected that this diffuse model is more physical.
But adding degrees of freedom to the background model can remove
likely spurious sources that correlate with features in the Galactic
diffuse emission.  Therefore, this tests systematics that may be
due to incorrect modeling of the diffuse emission in the region.
The results of this fit for the new extended source candidates are shown
in table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results}. There is good agreement between
the \ts using the standard and alternative diffuse models, suggesting
that the sources are robust against features in the diffuse model.

We do not except the systematic error due to uncertainties in the PSF to
be correlated to the systematic due to uncertainty in the Galactic diffuse
emission so the total systematic error on the extension of a source so
we obtain the total systematic error by adding them in quadrature.

\section{Analysis of Extended Sources in 2FGL}
\label{validate_known}

% 6 SNRs 

We first present on our analysis of the twelve extended sources
included in 2FGL.
(\cite{second_cat}).
The six extended SNRs IC443, W28, W30, W44, W51C, and the
Cygnus Loop were included in 2FGL.  IC443, W28, W44, W51C were
first reported in (\cite{ic443,w28,w44,w51c}).  Detailed papers
by the LAT collaboration studying W30 and the Cygnus Loop are
still in preparation.  \gev emission from W30 was also studied in
(\cite{castro_and_slane_2010}).  Using photons with energies between
1 \gev and 100 \gev, our analysis significantly detected the extension
of all six SNRs. 
% 2 galaxies

Two nearby galaxies the Large Magalenic Cloud and the Small Magalenic
Cloud were included in 2FGL (\cite{lmc,smc}).  They were significantly
detected using photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100 \gev. Our
fit extension is comparable to the published result, but we note that
previous publication used a more complicated double Gaussian spatial
model when fitting the LMC.

% 3 PWN
Three pulsar wind nebula Vela X, MSH 15-52, and HESS\,J1825-137 were
included in 2FGL (\cite{velax,msh1552,fermi_hess_j1825}).  Using photons
with energy above 10 \gev, we significantly detected the extension of
HESS\,J1825-137.  To improve the model of this source, we removed the
nearby catalog source 2FGL\,J1823.1-1338c which is part of the extended
source.  To avoid the nearby pulsar PSR J1509-5850, MSH 15-52 must be
analyzed at high energies.  Using photons with energies above 10 \gev,
we fit the extension of MSH 15-52 to be consistent with the published
size with an extension significance of \tsext=6.5.  

% failed to detect vela x + cen a
Our analysis was unable to resolve Vela X which would have required first
removing the pulsed photons from the Vela pulsar. This is beyond the
scope of this paper.  Our analysis also failed to detect a significant
extension for the Centaurus A Lobes (\cite{cen_a_lat}). This is because
the source's emission is significantly more complicated than a uniform
radially symmetric Disk.

Our analysis of these sources is summarized in
table~\ref{known_extended_sources}.  This table includes the best fit
position and extension of these sources when fitting them with a radially
symmetric uniform disk spatial model.  It also includes the best fit
spectral parameters for each source.  The position and extension of Vela
X and the Centaurus A Lobes are included in this list for completeness.

\section{Test of 1LAC Sources}
\label{test_1lac_sources}

To validate our method, we test associated AGN for extension.  \gev
emission from AGN is believed to comes from the core of supermassive
blackholes in small regions in the core of distant galaxies. Therefore AGN
are not expected to be spatially resolvable and provide a good calibration
source to demonstrate the efficacy of our tool. Nevertheless, it would
be interesting if AGN could be spatially resolved and there are theories
that predict this (\cite{pair_halo_paper}).

Following 1FGL, the LAT collaboration published a list of sources that
had a high probability association with AGN (\cite{first_agn_cat}).
1FGL had 709 1FGL sources associated with 671 distinct AGN at high
latitude ($|b|>10\deg$).  An upcoming publication by the LAT collaboration
using two years of data and the 2FGL catalog associates 1017 2FGL sources
with AGN.  To avoid systematic problems with AGN classification, we
selected the 815 AGN which made it into the clean AGN sample.  An AGN
association is considered clean only if it has a high probability
of association $P\ge 80\%$, if it is the only AGN associated with the
catalog source, and if there are no flags on the source in 2FGL. These
last two conditions are important for our analysis. Source
confusion may look like a spatially extended source and flagged catalog
sources may correlate with unmodeled structure in the diffuse emission.

Of the 815 clean AGN, we select 775 of these 2FGL sources which
are significant above 1 \gev and fit each of them for extension.
A histogram of the \tsext values computed for these AGN is shown in
figure~\ref{agn_ts_ext}. Overlaid on the plot is a $\chi^2/2$ distribution
suggested by Wilks' Theorem.  The \tsext distribution for AGN shows good
agreement with the theoretical distribution.  Two sources had $\tsext>9$.
One was due to incorrectly pruning a nearby catalog sources and the
other was due to a failure of convergence of the point hypothesis.
This result demonstrates that we can use \tsext as a measure of the
statistical significance of the detection of the extension of a source.

We should clarify that the LAT PSF used in this study was determined
empirically by fitting the observed shape of bright AGN (see
section~\ref{systematic_errors_on_extension}). Finding that the AGN we
test are not extended is not surprising. Trying to look for the extension
of AGN would require a more specialized analysis.

Nine extended sources not include in 2FGL were found using this search.
Three were found in our search using photons with energies between
1 \gev and 100 \gev and six were found using photons with energies between
10 \gev and 100 \gev.  The fit properties of these nine sources is summarized in
table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  This table includes for each source
the best fit position, extension, spectrum, source significance, and

For the new extended sources, table~\ref{dual_localization_results}

Table~\ref{alt_diff_model_results} contains the fit extensions

extension of $0.37\deg\pm0.03\deg\stat\pm0.02\deg\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of $\tsext=46.3$.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(260.32\deg,-3.28\deg)$.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248} shows a
counts map of this source.  This source is coincident with the one year
catalog source 1FGL\,J0823.3-4248.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL\,J0823.4-4305 and 2FGL\,J0821.0-4254 which are part of the
extended source.  We tested the source for source confusion by fitting
it as two point sources. Because $\tsinc=22.1$ is smaller then \tsext,
we conclude that this is an extended source.  These modifications are
shown in figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248}.

This extended source is spatially coincident with the SNR Puppis A.
Overlaid on figure~\ref{1FGL_J0823.3-4248} are ROSAT contours of Puppis

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1627.0-2425c was found 
using 1-100 \gev photons to have an 
extension of $0.41\deg\pm0.05\deg\stat\pm0.02\deg\sys$ 
with an extension significance of $\tsext=31.1$. 
The best fit position is $(l,b)=(353.08\deg, 16.78\deg)$.
This source is coincident with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J1628.6-2419c.
A counts map showing this source is
seen in figure \ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c}.  To test for source confusion,
we also fit the source instead as two point sources. Since $\tsinc=20.0$
is smaller than \tsext, we conclude that this is an extended source.

This source is in a region of remarkably complicated diffuse emission.
Even though it is 16\deg from the Galactic plane, the source is on top
of the core of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud which contains massive
star-forming regions that are bright in the infrared.  We have overlaid
on figure~\ref{1FGL_J1628.6-2419c} contours of the 100 micrometer infared
image of this region measured by IRAS. There is good spatial overlap
with the \gev emission (\cite{iras_rho_ophiuci}).

The region also has abundant molecular and atomic gas traced by CO
and HI but also plenty of dark gas, the kind that we find only by its
association with dust emission. Embedded star-forming regions make it even
more challenging to measure the column density of dust.  Although this
region is significantly extended, we conclude that this source most
likely represents inadequacy in the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission model.

\todo[inline]{Can we get another citation about dark gas and stuff?

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051 was found using 10-100 \tev
photons to have an extension of $0.33\deg\pm0.04\deg\stat\pm0.01\deg\sys$
with an extension significance of \tsext=16.3.  The source
was fit to a position of $(l,b)=(332.38\deg,-0.14\deg)$.
This source is coincident with the one year catalog source
1FGL\,J1613.6-5100c. Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c} shows a counts map
of this source.

This source is less than 1\deg away from 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 which is
also spatially extended (see section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}).
To get a good fit of both sources, we had to model both sources as
being spatially extended and iteratively fit the position and extension
of each source until obtaining a global best fit.  Before doing this,
We removed from our model the source 2FGL\,J1614.9-5212 because it is
part of 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138's. Furthermore, we removed the nearby catalog
sources 2FGL\,J1619.7-5040c and 2FGL\,J1620.6-5111c because they were not
significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications are further described
in the caption to figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.  After modifying
the region, we found that \tsinc=11.9 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1616-508 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}, contours of HESS\,J1616-508 are overlaid
on 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051.  The H.E.S.S. experiment measured a Gaussian
extension $0.136\pm 0.008$ when fitting the source with an elliptical
Gaussian spatial model.  This size corresponds to a 68\% containment
radius of $\rsixeight=0.21\deg\pm0.01\deg$. This size is comparable to the LAT
size $\rsixeight=0.27\deg\pm0.03\deg$ (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051
connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1616-508.

HESS\,J1616-508 is located in the region of two SNRs, RCW103 (G332.4-04)
and Kes 32 (G332.4+0.1) but is not spatially coincident with either
of them.  HESS\,J1616-508 is near three pulsars near PSR J1614-5048,
PSR J1616-5109, and PSR J1617-5055 but only PSR J1617-5055 only
PSR J1617-5055 is energetically favored as being the \tev emitter
(\cite{integral_HESS_J1616-508}).  \cite{hess_plane_survey}
speculated that this young pulsar could be responsible for the
emission of HESS\,J1616-508.  HESS\,J1616-508 is 9' away from PSR
J1617-5055, which was discovered during ASCA observations of RCW 103
(\cite{discovery_of_PSR_J1617-5055}). Using an outer gap magnetospheric
pulsar model, it was previously predicted to be a \tev emitter
(\cite{pulsar_tev_emission_predictions}).

The pulsar's position is offset from the maximum of the H.E.S.S
emission and would require an asymetric PWNe to power the \tev
emission. Offset PWN are expected on theoretical grounds due
to the PWNe being crushed by an asymmetric SNR reverse shock
(\cite{offset_pwn_ahronian,offset_pwn_blondin}) but this makes a
possible association more difficult.  For HESS\,J1825-137, the X-ray
emission is directed along the \tev offset making this association more
compelling.\cite{hess_j1825_hess}.


In the region around HESS\,J1616-508, Suzaku found only an upper limit
in the 2-10 \kev energy range and suggested this source as an example
of a ``dark particle accelerator'' (\cite{suzakzu_HESS_J1616-508}).
\cite{integral_HESS_J1616-508} found no evidence of hard X-ray emission
in the region of HESS\,J1616-508 in the 20-100 \kev energy band with the
IBIS/ISGRBI on board INTEGRAL. They also observed the field with the XRT
on board {\em Swift} between 0.2-10 \kev and found no compelling source
counterpart. Using archival XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX data, they found no
plausible X-ray counterpart except for PSR J1617-5055.

Finally, Chandra ACIS observations of PSR J1617-5055 revealed
an underlomonous PWN $\approx1'$ in size around the pulsar
(\cite{discovery_of_pwn_for_PSR_J1617-5055}). But the PWN is not
assymetric towards HESS\,J1616-508 which casts doubt upon the association.


Note about this this paper finds other stuff: (\cite{discovery_of_pwn_for_PSR_J1617-5055}).


The \gev emission is suggested to be the same emission component as
the \tev emission, but further observations of this source at other
frequencies will likely be needed to firmly associated this source.

\label{section_2FGL_J1615.2-5138}

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138 was found 
using 10-100 \gev photons to have
an extension of $0.42\deg\pm0.03\deg\stat\pm0.01\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of \tsext=48.0.  The source was fit to a position
of $(l,b)=(331.66\deg,-0.66\deg)$.  This source is coincident
with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J1614.7-5138c.  Because 2FGL
J1615.2-5138 is close to 2FGL\,J1615.0-5051, the same model described
in section~\ref{section_2FGL_J1615.0-5051} was used to analyze both
sources. Both sources can be seen in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}.
For 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138, \tsinc=37.0 which is less than \tsext so we
conclude that the source is extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1614-518 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}). In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1613.6-5100c}, contours of HESS\,J1614-518 are overlaid
on 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138.  The H.E.S.S. experiment measured a Gaussian
extension of $\sigma=0.23\deg\pm0.02\deg$ and $\sigma=0.15\pm0.02$ in
the semi-major and semi-minor axis. This size corresponds to a 68\%
containment size of $\rsixeight=0.35\deg\pm0.03\deg$ and $0.23\pm0.03$.
This elliptical size matches the LAT size $\rsixeight=0.35\deg\pm0.03\deg$.
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1615.2-5138
connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1614-518.

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c was found 
using 10-100 \gev photons to
have an extension of $0.44\deg\pm0.04\deg\stat\pm0.03\deg\sys$ 
with an extension
significance of \tsext=64.5.  The source was fit to a position of
$(l,b)=(336.41\deg,0.22\deg)$.  This source is coincident with the one
year catalog source 1FGL\,J1632.9-4802c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}
shows a counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove from our model
three catalog sources 2FGL\,J1631.7-4720c, 2FGL\,J1630.2-4752,
2FGL J1634.4-4743c.4-4820c that were part of the extended source..
We then iteratively relocalized the source 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c
to $(l,b)=(337.230\deg,0.346\deg)$ and 2FGL\,J1636.3-4740c to
$(l,b)=(336.968\deg,-0.066\deg)$ while fitting the extension of
2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c.  In addition we removed from our model four
farther away two year catalog sources 2FGL\,J1638.0-4703c, 2FGL
J1628.1-4857c, 2FGL  J1630.1-4615, 2FGL\,J1639.8-4921c because they
were not significant above 10 \gev.  These modifications are shown
in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}.  To test for source confusion,
we compared the likelihood fitting this region as one extended source
to the likelihood fitting this region as two point sources. We found
$\tsinc=40.6$ which is less than \tsext so we conclude
that this is an extended source.

This extended source is spatially coincident with the extended
\tev source HESS\,J1632-478 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1632.9-4802c}, contours of  HESS\,J1632-478 are
overlaid on 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c.  H.E.S.S measured a Gaussian extension of
$\sigma=0.21\pm0.05$ and $0.06\pm0.04$ along the semi-major and semi-minor
axes when fitting the source with an elliptical Gaussian spatial model.
This corresponds to a 68\% containment size $\rsixeight=0.31\deg\pm0.08\deg$
and $0.09\pm0.06$ along the semi-major and semi-minor axis. This
size is consistent with the LAT size $\rsixeight=0.36\deg\pm0.04\deg$.
Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum of 2FGL\,J1635.4-4717c
connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of HESS\,J1632-478 and most
likely corresponds to the same emission process

\cite{hess_plane_survey} argued that this source is positionally
coincident with the hard X-ray source IGR\,J1632-4751 discovered above
15 \kev by the INTEGRAL satellite (\cite{Igr_J16320-4751_circ}).
It was also observed by XMM-Newton between 2 and 10 \kev
(\cite{xmm_newton_IGR_J16320-4751}) and ASCI between 0.7 and 10 \kev
(\cite{asca_plane_survey}).  But this X-ray source is suspected to be
an galactic X-Ray Binary so the \gev and \tev extension HESS\,J1632-478
and 2FGL\,J1632.4-4753c disfavors the association.

Further observations of the region around HESS\,J1632-478 by XMM-Newton
reveal extended emission between 0.2 \kev and 15 \kev with an elliptical
size of $\approx32''$ and $\approx15''$ in the semi-major and semi-minor
axes and inside this extended emission was point-like emission
(\cite{hess_j1632_478_xmm_newton}).  This x-ray source is positionally
coincident with the \tev centroid of the H.E.S.S source.  In addition,
they used data from MGPS-2, an 843 MHz survey of the galactic plane
carried out with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST)
to detect an extended diffuse radio source whose size matches well the
extended X-ray emission \cite{most_survey_galactic_plane}.

They argued that the positional match between the radio and X-ray
observations argues for a single synchrotron processes emitting from
radio to X-ray.  This same source could be responsible for the \tev
emission due to inverse Compton and this matches the expected emission
from a typical PWNe.

The increased \gev and \tev size compared to the X-ray size
has previously been observed in several aging PWNe including 
HESS\,J1825-137 (\cite{hess_j1825_xmm_newton,hess_j1825_hess} and HESS\,J1640-465
(\cite{hess_plane_survey,xmm_newton_hess_j_1640-466}) and can be explained
by the electrons emitting syncrotron radiation having a shorter lifetime
than the electrons emitting inverse Compton radiation.

Because of the spectral and spatial match between the \gev and \tev
emission, the LAT data naturally fits into this model as being the rising
edge of the inverse Compton component of a PWN.

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c was found 
with 10-100 \gev photons 
to have an extension

with an extension
significance of $\tsext=18.8$.  The source was fit to a position of

year catalog source 1FGL\,J1837.5-0659c.  Figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}
shows a counts map of this source.

This source is in a complicated region. There are three nearby
catalog sources 2FGL\,J1834.7-0705c, 2FGL\,J1836.8-0623c, and
2FGL\,J1839.3-0558c.  To get a good fit of 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c, we
relocalized 2FGL\,J1834.7-0705c to $(l,b)=(24.77\deg,0.50\deg)$,
2FGL\,J1836.8-0623c to $(l,b)=(25.57\deg,0.32\deg)$, and
2FGL\,J1839.3-0558c to $(l,b)=(26.08\deg,0.23\deg)$.  We removed the
nearby catalog source 2FGL\,J1835.5-0649 which is part of the extended
source and also the farther away catalog source 2FGL\,J1839.0-0539
because it was not significant above 10 \gev. These modifications are
shown in figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}.  After modifying the region,
we found that \tsinc=12.6 which is less than \tsext, so we conclude that
the source is spatially extended.

This source is spatially coincident with the \tev
source HESS\,J1837-069 (\cite{hess_plane_survey}).  In
figure~\ref{1FGL_J1837.5-0659c}, contours of HESS\,J1837-069
are overlaid on 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c. H.E.S.S. measured a 
Gaussian extension
of $\sigma=0.12\pm0.02$ and $0.05\pm0.02$ along the semi-major and
semi-minor axis when fitting the source with an elliptical Gaussian
spatial model.  This corresponds to a 68\% containment radius of
$\rsixeight=0.18\deg\pm0.03\deg$ and $0.08\deg\pm0.03\deg$ along the semi-major
and semi-minor axis. The size is comparable to LAT which fit a 68\%
containment radius of $\rsixeight=0.29\deg\pm0.07\deg$.  The LAT size is larger
than the H.E.S.S. size but the sizes are almost almost within the
$1\sigma$ errors. Figure~\ref{hess_seds} shows that the LAT spectrum
of 2FGL\,J1837.3-0700c connects smoothly to the H.E.S.S spectrum of
HESS\,J1837-069.

The two year catalog source 2FGL\,J2021.5+4026 was found with 10-100 \gev
photons to have an extension of $0.59\deg\pm0.03\deg\stat\pm0.02\deg\sys$
with an extension significance of $\tsext=116.4$.  The source was
fit to a position of $(l,b)=(78.18\deg,2.19\deg)$.  This source
is coincident with the one year catalog source 1FGL\,J2020.0+4049.
Figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049} shows a counts map of this source.

To get a good fit of the source, we had to remove the nearby catalog
source 2FGL\,J2019.1+4040 which were part of the extended source.
Further, we found it necessary to add an additional point source not in
the two year catalog into our background model.  The new source is was
localized to a position of $(l,b)=(78.85\deg,2.67\deg)$ and had $\ts=13.5$ .
Although the source is not very significant, not including it into the
background model appeared visually to significantly throw off the fit
of the region.  In addition, we removed the four further away catalog
sources 2FGL\,J2022.8+3843c, 2FGL\,J2020.0+4159, 2FGL\,J2013.8+4115c,
and 2FGL\,J2012.4+3955c from the region because they were not significant
above 10 \gev.  After modifying the region, we found that \tsinc=24.3
which is less than \tsext, so we believe that this source is spatially
extended.  These modifications are further described in the caption to
figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049}.

This source is spatially coincident with the Gamma Cygni SNR.  Contours of
Gamma Cygni at 408MHz from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey are overlaid
on figure~\ref{1FGL_J2020.0+4049} and there is good spatial agreement
with the LAT emission (\cite{canadian_galactic_plane_survey}).

\section{Conclusion}

\todo[inline]{This conclusion needs to be written.}

Many extended sources. Instructive to use photons with energy
above 10 \gev where we don't have to worry about diffuse background
as much.

Make some conclusion about how the LAT will eventually collect a factor
of five more data! \pointlike will be necessary to improve the model of
the high energy sky. Hard to do a blind analysis of LAT data.

Figure~\ref{allsky_extended_sources} is an all sky map showing the
location of all \gev extended sources. Note how most extended sources
are in the Galactic plane.

Figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_histogram} is a histogram comparing the size of
all extended sources seen in \gev by the LAT and in \tev by H.E.S.S..
Note how H.E.S.S. can see smaller sources whereas the LAT can see
bigger sources.

For all extended sources seen both in \gev and \tev,
figure~\ref{gev_vs_tev_plot} shows a comparison of their sizes.
Note that there is pretty good agreement.

Note about how comparison of HESS and LAT sizes will require more accurate
ellitpical gaussian fitting + using the same spatial model.  Interesting
to see if there is a correlation for PWN between energy and source size!

LAT has a planned lifetime of 5 years with (don't know how to phrase this) 
hope to run for 10 years. Additonal data will allow us to perfrom
more detailed morphological and spectral analysis of these sources.

Improved diffuse model and better statisticsl will allow us to push
our analysis to lower energies.

    function of $\chi^2(\ts)/2$ which is suggested by Wilks' theorem

    good agreement between the Monte Carlo results and
    the theoretical distribution. For most spectral parameters, the
    Monte Carlo curve lies to the left of the theoretical curve which

    the extension of a uniform disk extended source and the $y$ axis
    is the source's 100 \mev to 100 \gev photon flux.  All sources have
    an assumed power-law spectrum and the different colors are different
    simulated spectral indices.  The solid line is the detection threshold
    using photons with energy between 100 \mev and 100 \gev while the
    dashed line is the threshold using photons with energy between 1 \gev
    and 100 \gev.  The detection threshold is for the same two year time

    This plot shows that our threshold to detecting the extension of
    a source is best for a source with size $~0.5\deg$. It also shows
    that for sources neither too large nor soft, our sensitivity is not
    significantly improved using photons with energy between 100 \mev

    source for varying background levels
    and energy ranges.  The plots have the same meaning as in
    figure~\ref{index_sensitivity} and the simulations occur over the
    same time range.  The solid blue line is the detection threshold against a
    Sreekumar-like isotropic background. The green dashed curve is the
    threshold against 10 times the isotropic background and the dash
    dotted red curve is the threshold against 100 times the isotropic
    background.  The latter factor approximately represents the intensity
    of the Galactic diffuse emission near the Galactic center.  Plot (a)
    is the threshold using photons with energies between 1 \gev and 100
    \gev while plot (b) is the threshold using photons with energies
    between 10 \gev and 100 \gev. Unlike figure~\ref{index_sensitivity},
    the detection threshold was calculated only for a power-law source of spectral
    index 2. The flux is quoted only in the selected energy range which
    weakens the dependence of the detection threshold on spectral index.
    These plots show that we are less sensitive to extended sources in
    regions with higher background and (given the same number of photons)
    more sensitive to harder sources.  Overlaid on this plot are the
    extended sources found in this extended source search. The extended
    sources are color coded based upon whether the integral galactic
    diffuse and isotropic diffuse emission model is closer to 1x, 10x,
    or 100x the Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum.  The red point
    in plot (a) below the red line is RX J1713.7-3946 which is harder
    ($\gamma\approx1.5$) and has diffuse emission only 53 times larger
    than the isotropic emission.  The green point in plot (b) below
    the green line is MSH 15-52 which was found by our analysis to
    have $\tsext=6.5$.  More information about this plot is presented

      \caption{For the new extended source candidates
      in table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}, we describe the
      results of the dual localization procedure described in
      section~\ref{dual_localization_method}. Here, the extended
      source candidate is not fit as an extended source but instead
      fit as two point sources.  The dual localization is performed
      with \pointlike and results in the best fit position of the two
      sources $(\glon_1,\glat_1)$ and $(\glon_2,\glat_2)$.  The change
      in likelihood and spectral values are then computed using \gtlike
      with the best fit positions found by \pointlike.  \tsinc is the
      increase in TS fitting the region as two sources compared to
      fitting compared to fitting a single point source and is computed
      using \gtlike with the best fit positions taken from \pointlike.
      It can be directly compared to \tsext, which is taken from
      table~\ref{new_ext_srcs_table}.  For all of our candidates, $\tsext
      > \tsinc$ which shows that an extended source fits the source better
      than two point sources.  As in table~\ref{known_extended_sources},
      flux is measured in units of $10^{-9}\ph/\cm^2/\sec$ and is the
      integral flux between 1 \gev (10 \gev) and 100 \gev for the sources
      found using photons above 1 \gev (10 \gev).}

    The LAT extension of Vela X is from (\cite{velax}).  Except for RX
    J1713.7-3946 Vela Jr., the \tev sources were fit with a Gaussian
    spatial model so the plotted \gev and \tev extensions were first
    converted to \rsixeight (see section~\ref{compare_source_size}).
    Because of their large size, the RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Jr.
    were not directly fit in \tev. The \tev radius of RX J1713.7-3946
    is taken to be 0.5\deg and Vela Jr. to be 1\deg and the LAT size
    is not converted to \rsixeight. The LAT extension errors are
    the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature. This
    plot shows that there is a correlation between the \gev and \tev
    sizes of sources.  The \tev size of MSH 15-52, HESS\,J1614-518,
    HESS\,J1632-478, and HESS\,J1837-069 have only been reported with

      \caption{The detection threshold to resolve a uniform disk spatially
      extended sources using two years of data for sources of varying
      spectral index and extension against varying background levels
      with different energy ranges.  The upper table is the sensitivity
      when using photons with energies from 1-100 \gev and the bottom
      table is when using 10-100 \gev photons. The first column is
      the extended source's spectral index.  The extended sources
      were simulated against a Sreekumar-like isotropic spectrum and
      the second column is the factor that the simulated background
      was scaled by. The remaining columns are varying sizes of the
      source's spatial model. The table quotes fluxes in units of
      $10^{-10} \ph/\cm^2/\sec$.  These values are also plotted in
      figure~\ref{all_sensitivity}.  More information about this
      table is presented in section~\ref{extension_sensitivity}.
