\title{Search for Spatially Extended Sources Using Two Years of Flight
Data}


\begin{document}

\abstract{
We present a new method for analyzing spatially 
extended sources with the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument
on the {\em Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}.
We provide a series of Monte Carlo studies
that were done to validate this tool.
We then apply this tool to test all sources in
the 2FGL Two Year Catalog for extension
and report on the discovery of new extended sources.\cite{2FGL}

Performing morphological studies of sources in the GeV energy range
using the Fermi LAT is challenging primarily because of the significantly
energy dependent point spread function and because of systematic errors
in the galactic diffuse emission. The Fermi PSF varies from over $XXXXX^\circ$
at 100MeV to $XXXXX^\circ$ at 100GeV and so the higher energy photons are
significantly more important for studying the shape of sources. One could ideally look just at the
highest energy photons, but the trade off is that for typical sources
many more source events are expected at low energy.
For this reason, it is especially important to use as much of the data as possible.

The second primary difficult in studying spatially extended sources is systematic 
uncertainties in the diffuse emission. Systematic errors are notoriously difficult
and will be discussed more later, but the important point to make here
is that one of the most important diagnostic tools for studying systematic errors
is being able to iterate the analysis while varying different parameters such
as what goes into the diffuse model.

A new analysis tool has been developed to address these unique requirements for studying
spatially extended sources with the Fermi LAT. The overall approach for this
analysis is to perform a maximum likelihood analysis where the Poisson likelihood
for observing the measured counts is computed given an assumed sky model. The
parameters of the sky model are then fit by maximizing the log of the likelihood.
To study the extension of a source, one can assume a particular shape for an
extended source (e.g. a disk or Gaussian), and fit the spatial parameters of
that source. 

\section{Validation}

One can define a parameter, called $\text{TS}_\text{ext}$ as twice the increase
in log likelihood going from fitting a source with a point hypothesis to fitting
it as an extended hypothesis. So $\text{TS}_\text{ext}=2\times(LL_\text{ext}-LL_\text{ps})$.
In going from fitting a point source to fitting a simple extended source such as
a disk, one degree of freedom, the source width, is added. According to
Wilk's Theorem, the distribution of $\text{TS}_\text{ext}$ for no signal (a true
point source) should follow a $\chi^2$ distribution with one degree of freedom\cite{Wilks_Theorem}.
On the other hand, since the null hypothesis exists on the edge of parameter space,
and so so Wilk's Theorem does not hold\cite{Warnings about Wilk's Thorem}.
One might expect the actual distribution to be a half $\chi^2$ distribution with a delta
function at 0. This was the distribution found to be true for source finding of
gamma ray sources.\cite{Mattox_et_All_Paper}. A Monte Carlo study has been performed to
show how well we can believe the statistical significance.
