\title{Search for Spatially Extended Sources Using Two Years of Flight
Data}


\begin{document}

\abstract{
We present a new method for analyzing spatially 
extended sources with the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument
on the {\em Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}.
We provide a series of Monte Carlo studies
that were done to validate this tool.
We then apply this tool to test all sources in
the 2FGL Two Year Catalog\cite{2FGL} for extension
and report on the discovery of new extended sources.
