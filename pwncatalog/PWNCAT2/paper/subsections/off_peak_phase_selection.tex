\subsection{Off-peak Phase Selection}
\label{subsec:off_peak_defintion}



To study the off-peak emission of \lat-detected pulsars, we first
developed a new method for defining the off-peak emission.
The primary constraint for this method was that it was systematic,
computationally efficient, and model independent.

The method we developed procedes by deconstructing a pulsar phaseogram
into a Baysian blocks using the implementation described in \cite{Jackson_Bayesian_Blocks_2003}.

Set the ncpPrior parameter to 5?
