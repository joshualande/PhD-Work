Compiling the latex:

    There is a standard makefile.
    make         -> builds the PDF (by default in color)
    make color   -> build the paper (in color)
    make bw      -> build the paper (in black and white)
    make clean   -> remove temporary files

Organization:

casa_2nd_lat.tex is the top level file.  It inputs all the other files.

casa_2nd_lat.bib is the bibtex bibliography file.

There are a few standard style files sitting around:

aastex.cls
apj.bst
