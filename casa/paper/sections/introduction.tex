\section{Introduction}

The introduction goes here\ldots

Somewhere in the introduction, we mention 2FGL \citep{second_lat_catalog}.

When refering to \lat, there is a \lat command to make your life easy.
\fermi also has a command.

We can refer to future sections. For example, \secref{discussion} is the discussion section.
